# How to Lend a Hand

Most of the assistance needed to make this project work better involves reviewing for accuracy each tracks' respective JSON file that contains its speakers and subtitles. These can be found at [/jekyll/assets/json](jekyll/assets/json).

To discuss, offer ideas, or give feedback, please use the [Discussions tab on GitHub](https://github.com/willjasen/wallace-thrasher/discussions)

If you would like to contribute to updating speakers & subtitles:

 - create a [fork](https://github.com/willjasen/wallace-thrasher/fork) of this project
 - make and save the appropriate changes within your fork
 - create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for merging

Once a pull request is created, the changes will be reviewed and merged into the project if everything looks good!
