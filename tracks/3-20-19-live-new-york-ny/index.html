      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Big forever, thank you.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Two, in your, like, last two albums, you've changed under having, like, one track with one person for a longer period of time.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Take it of, like, legalese.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Is this a thing you're trying...<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Is this like what we can expect?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Is this what you're doing going forward?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Or is that just coincidental?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't think I heard the first part.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But then you mentioned Illegalese, where I talked to the lady for a long time?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I always love it when I call somebody, and they were sitting by the phone waiting to talk to somebody else,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and then they figure I'm that person, you know?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And so that happened with Illegalese, and that was fun. It's always neat.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> On that album, you had a couple of tracks where you talked to one person for a long time.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> So that's an incredible button.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Or that happened to happen.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Like legalese and with that racist Florida flag guy,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> had a couple of tracks, we talked to one person for a longer period of time than what you usually do.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Is that something you're trying that's new, or is that like just the way it happened to happen,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> or is this like a new thing you're shifting into, or was that just a happy coincidence?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Honestly, I don't know if you'll buy this, but I think it's really kind of inherent in putting out a CD.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Like, back when I made cassettes all the time,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> there was so little, like, delineation between one thing and another thing.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It just kind of all bled into the next thing to where it was hard to even pinpoint where something happened.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But with CDs and stuff, you really have to define the beginning in the end.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And, yeah, if it sounds good, I'm going to go for it.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm going to include it.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I guess it has gotten a little more long form to answer your question.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So, yeah, things have gotten a lot more long form now that I think about it.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> There used to be just like 15.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> or 60, you know, three-second, five-second, 10-second things.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And that's kind of gone out a little bit with the digital stuff.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Cool.<br>
    </li>

    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Hi.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I feel like your older albums are a bit more casual, and you're not really as aggressive in how you talk to people.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> But in the newer ones, you're far more forceful.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I was wondering if you do that on purpose or something just changed.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's the drugs.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Good.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, you know, I was a teenager, you know, I hadn't, I had never left the state of Colorado.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I was usually on restriction, grounded. My parents did not want me to go do anything because I was<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> pretty out of control at that time. So now, I don't know. You know, I'm always getting older and changing<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and growing. And sometimes, to be perfectly honest with you, it seems like I didn't set it<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> upright, so I have to yell for them to hear me. And I didn't even realize I was.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I was yelling until afterwards. I was like, I was yelling at that guy. So, yeah, a little bit of<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> everything in there, probably.<br>
