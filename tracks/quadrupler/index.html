    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> what's available, they should be able to do something with the price for you.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Whatever you have is bringing in, and we can see they can match it important.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just bring all my quadruplers in there.<br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I mean, you said your coupons.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I was saying, if you wanted to see if we could give you money to match with the coupons,<br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> First my rear shake is Garrett, I'm not.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, Garrett, what's the limit on the number of couplers I can have when I'm quadrupling my signal?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't even know.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I got a rubber running through a flipper.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm trying to quadruple, but all I've got are triplers, and I do have a couple couplers,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> but I'm trying to scale down, and, you know, I don't have a lot of money either,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> so I'm budget conscious, too.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Is there a coupon or something I can apply towards this?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I mean, the couplers are cheap, how much as a couple.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Do you know what kind of coupler you need?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> A rubber.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> A rubber, coupler?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> What's the couplers for?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> For my flipper.<br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Flipper.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What does it do?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've got a tripler on it for my signal, but I'm really trying to quadruple it.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I've got rubber with the tripler and the two couplers to reverse my adapter, basically.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I'm trying to multiply my couplers into my rubber.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> To be honest, I have no idea.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I cannot tell you. I'm not going to make something up.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You can tell me, I mean.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Uh, I don't even, what does the flipper do? I don't even...<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, my rubber.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Okay, maybe my coworker can help you. I'm not going to be able to help you.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, if it's proprietary, I won't share the information.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Hello?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hi.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What's going on here?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> What kind of coupler are you looking for?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> So we have couplers for co-ax, and we have couplers for HGMI.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sure.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I'm trying to quadruple my signal.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and all I've got to tripler and a couple couplers, my flipper is joined with my multiplier and my rubber.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So how many multipliers can I fit with my divider before I have to get just a joiner?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I mean, you could go, you can go the max.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Like, if you can put all your connections together at once, then you can go the max.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> And we have a three-way splitter.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I think we might have a four-way splitter.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, but my tripler is going to end up multiple.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> applying my coupler, you understand? So my signal will be coupled with the flipper. And plus my<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> coupon, I don't know if you're sticklers. Because it may have been expired. Actually, there's no<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> year on it. It just says the date of the month and the day. Essentially, so I'm tripling my rubber.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> My signal's quadrupled, but I'm trying to run my subtractor through the coupler so that my flipper can<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> adapt to the reverser. And the coupon, I don't know if you're a stickler.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah, the coupon ends on the 25th, and it doesn't have, like, a valid end date.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah. It may be expired by now.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah, the coupon, I'm pretty sure that's expired.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Would you need to feel my rubber, so that you could best advise which trickler to use?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Um, I don't know.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So if you're flipping my rubber, my trickler's going to multiply the divider,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and my signal will be reversed down to the base of coupler to that stage.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah, I mean, when realistic factors,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> and the coupler and the dividers and the multiplier's just going all nuts and your rubber's going crazy.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah. Maybe somebody could come over and take a gander?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Oh, no, we can't send anybody out to check out your rubber.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh. Okay, would you please talk to the gargler, and maybe he could better explain it, because I, you know...<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What do you need?<br>
    </li>
