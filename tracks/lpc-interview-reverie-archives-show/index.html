    <li>
      
          <i>223</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> because a lot of people describe your calls as surrealist.<br>

          <i>224</i> --

    <li>
      
          <i>268</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Michael:</strong> It actually came about because the director and I had been listening to a lot of your albums while we were in the edit.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>269</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Michael:</strong> Of course, I was doing sound design on it, and we just kept talking about how we needed to add something to the phone operator.<br>

    <li>
      
          <i>270</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Michael:</strong> And since I was playing it, I jokingly said we should just find a way to put Longmont Potion Castle in the film.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>271</i> --

    <li>

    <li>
      
          <i>276</i> --

    <li>
      
          <i>278</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Michael:</strong> I think every now and then when you're working on something creative, you need some time off, a break.<br>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>281</i> --

    <li>
      
          <i>282</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> And, yeah, I'm wondering, like, what is your obsession with jargon?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>283</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> Why do you love jargon?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>284</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> Oh, because, you know, I have to say something.<br>

    <li>
      
          <i>285</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> Something that, I don't know, is worth saying, but we'll keep them on the line.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>286</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> And I just figure you might as well make it interesting, at least to myself.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>287</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> And so that comes in the form of funny names and scenarios and things like that that will engage people.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>288</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> They're not all keepers, but the ones that are, oh, boy, they sure are.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>289</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Michael:</strong> Do you have any particular favorites?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>290</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> tracks of all time?<br>

    <li>

    <li>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>296</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> I listened to probably like that first one, like maybe once a year, something like that.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>297</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> I still really like it, but it's so old that I just can't.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>298</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> bring myself to hear it constantly.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>299</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Michael:</strong> I think one of our favorites, and I believe it's on volume 10, is Dieter's heat.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>300</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> Yeah.<br>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>304</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Michael:</strong> What I appreciate about that call and a lot of others is how amenable people are to such an absurd circumstance,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>305</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Michael:</strong> and such an absurd call.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>306</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Michael:</strong> And, yeah, maybe that's something we're going to talk about a little bit to you.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>307</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, I mean, my favorites are always, and maybe this is because I'm a wimp, but the ones where people are kind of nice to you.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>308</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> Like, I think, like, Denise Plant, I love her.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>309</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> Poor thing.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>310</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> She just walked right into it.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>311</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> But then she really, she gives you the benefit of the doubt the whole time.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>312</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> She just assumes you misunderstood her and that the phone is independently losing his shit.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>313</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> And those are neither of those are your fault, and she's going to.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>314</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> correct the problem. And I wonder, like, for you, is it better when someone's cooperative<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>315</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> or when someone's a total asshole? Like, what for you is a better outcome? Well, like you were just saying<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>316</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> at this point, it's like businesses calling companies where they have someone who's going to, you know,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>317</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> try to work it out, work out whatever the situation is and is actually open. I like having that element<br>

      <strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah.<br>

    <li>
      
          <i>321</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> Well, we want to give you some phone and versus some recruiters, because I think those are people who always have to answer their phones.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>322</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> Let's do it.<br>

    <li>
      
          <i>324</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> But, yeah, I guess I was also wondering, partly because I saw that you worked for the labor union in L.A.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>325</i> --

    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>326</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> because it works sort of differently here.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>327</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> Yeah, that was a, that was a misprint.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>328</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> Oh, really?<br>

    <li>
      
          <i>329</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> I'm sure where they got that.<br>

    <li>
      
          <i>330</i> --

    <li>
      
          <i>332</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> Which was not made by me, but.<br>

    <li>
      
          <i>333</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, of course.<br>

    <li>
      
          <i>337</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> Well, I guess, but, I mean, it still applies.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>338</i> -- 
      
      <strong>Christina:</strong> Like, I've read a couple interviews with you where you say, like, when you were a teenager,<br>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>341</i> --

    </li>
    
    <li>
      
          <i>342</i> --

    <li>
      
          <i>343</i> -- 
      
      <strong>LPC:</strong> I mean, I definitely wouldn't say I focused on that or anything, but it's all torment, if you want to<br>

    <li>
      
          <i>347</i> --

    <li>
      
          <i>730</i> --

    <li>
      
          <i>733</i> --
