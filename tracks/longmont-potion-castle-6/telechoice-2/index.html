      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> What the hell are you talking about? Because I have no clue, and I don't think you should be sending messages to people that you have no clue what they're talking about.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hey, well, I don't know who sent the message. I don't know who's telling anyone they're stupid.<br>

      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> extension. And, you know, apparently you sent that message last week to all my coworkers<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and myself on our aspects. A couple of us responded to Pash and Hodges, so we thought it was,<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> we were mistaken, but we responded jokingly because obviously we took her message as a joke and then<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> you come back as a response, retaliating because you don't like our response. First of all, the message<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> that was sent on her extension was not having anything to do with work. It was a joke. We all took<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> it as a joke. A couple of us responded. You got my response. Now you're being hostile.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Don't respond to my message right now. Don't ever call my aspect again. And if you ever do,<br>

        <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> I don't know who this message was directed to, but I think everyone in Pat Young's group got<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> the message. Don't know what it's about, but says anyway.<br>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> I know it's not you because it's a guy that's doing this.<br>
