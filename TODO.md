# TODO

Notes about To-Do's have been moved into the Track JSON objects. This can be viewed within its residing file at [/jekyll/assets/data.json](/jekyll/assets/data.json).

These notes can also be seen on the website under certain circumstances. When the environment variable of `JEKYLL_ENV` is not set as 'production', then the To-Do notes will display underneath the track's heading (as well as other metadata).

An example of that looks like:

```
Track 7: Alex Trebek
Model used: distil-whisper/distil-large-v3
Speakers adjusted? true
Subtitles adjusted? false
To-Do: need to review subtitles for accuracy
```
