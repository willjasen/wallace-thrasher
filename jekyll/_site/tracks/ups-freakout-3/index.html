      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. Once you bring it, I'll come down and pick it up because the elevator is broken.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, matter of fact, we were there last night, but you were way too loud last night.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You didn't even hear the doorbell. I was not loud at all. I wasn't even home.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Much too loud.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's none of my affairs, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm going to call UPS. What the heck is that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I love detailed instructions on your door and you just disregarded it, huh?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's not true. That's not true at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yo, hell!
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, this guy keeps on calling me saying he's from UPS, and he's been at my door several times,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and he didn't leave a flyer or anything, and he was very rude to me and abrupt to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> He's a phone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> He's a phony.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> He's very rude to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You might need to let the police know, and he might be just trying to rob me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Who is the parcel addressed, too?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've already been out there twice, and you were way too loud to even hear me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Hey, do you want to deliver this parcel, or don't you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to try one more time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I think you're full of shit, and I think you should go to hell, and I think you shouldn't call here anymore.

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's not your bad business.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Why?
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm going to hang up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> This is one of the most extraordinary telephone calls that I've ever had in my life.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're one of the most despicable people I have ever talked to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Now you've got that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You guys turn around and take your drink truck where you came from.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Do not deliver this tank.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That could treat me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Because you're too weird to do it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't want to have it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So hang up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You can say goodbye.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And you've called me, fellow.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's pretty weird.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'll hang it up now so I can hear you in two seconds.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So let's just cut this bottle bottle off right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But boy, you're going to be in some real trouble with your superiors and supervising your real trouble.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No one even heard the bell.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So we're going to just be shipping your parcel back.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> We are home all last night.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, I know you were there because I was trying to deliver your box.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> What time did you try to pay for your box?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All kinds of commotion coming out.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I rang and rang and rang the bell and no one even bothered to answer it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So this thing is going back to the sender.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Wait a minute.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Wait a minute.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> But we were here in the kitchen.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> So if you deliver, who are you delivering this to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Let's get that one straight first.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And it says pedantic Luddite on there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I don't know who that is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Just tell me the name of the person you were trying to deliver it to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm Sylvester.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> You're still not answering the question.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Who was the delivery to be made to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I have never heard so much noise and commotion.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, that doesn't make a damn bit of...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> That's not answering my question.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Who was the delivery made to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I have never heard as much commotion as I heard last night.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Well, then you know what?
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> That's ridiculous.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> There was a huge uproar in there last night.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Oh, for God's sake.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Would you just tell me who you're delivering this to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> We don't have anything to talk about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It was unlike anything I've heard before.
      <br>

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, you know what?
      <br>
    </li>
