      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And then we're going to get everything erected. How's that sound?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I did not order it. I didn't do it. I don't do this kind of stuff.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> whatever. Just don't come to my house and erect a shed, as you say, because I'm not going to pay you for it.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh.
      <br>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Who is this? Monroe.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I heard that Monroe crap. Monroe, I've never even talked to you. I've never said anything bad about tough sheds.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But if you come to my house and arrest the shed at 7.30 in the morning, I feel.

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hey, Monroe. How are you doing?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I say, how are you doing?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's just a courtesy call that we'll be out there at 7.30 bright and early tomorrow to get your specs for your Tuft Shed.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I think you've got a mistake there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We're going to be there at 7.m. tomorrow to take your measurements.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Get your spec.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why is that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have to sign nothing for tough Shed. I am a shed company. We own the Shed Company.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> W. Debbie DeV. Jones was cooperating.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I've been the same location for 38 years, and I ain't got nothing against tough Shed.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Don't get me wrong.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But I don't need a shed built here at my place.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, then I need a deposit at the very least.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I'm through doing things on spec for you, people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We got ladies calling me up and telling me this and that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> My lady called you, or you called her.
      <br>

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm trying to tell you, sir, I'm a shed manufacturing company, and I get along with tough sheds.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I ain't got nothing bad to say about you whatsoever.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> None.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We're both into the shed business, but we ain't order no shan.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And we would fight in each other.
      <br>
