    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> getting upset about it. In a way, you can't blame them, but they've got to watch their mouth, too.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Before you be telling people they're stupid, you better make sure that you know that they're the ones not sending that message.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> You've got the wrong person, whoever you are, okay?<br>

    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Hey, if you're going to be sending messages to somebody, send it to only one person instead of everybody.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> What the hell are you talking about? Because I have no clue, and I don't think you should be sending messages to people that you have no clue what they're talking about.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hey, well, I don't know who sent the message. I don't know who's telling anyone they're stupid.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> That was a dumb remark.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Excuse me, I did not know who this is, but I did not tell anybody that they were stupid.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> And if you have something to say to me, please come to my desk and say it so that I know who you are.<br>
    </li>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> So why don't you know what you're talking about before you call me first?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Okay. Thanks a lot. Bye.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Listen, I don't know who you are, but whoever you are, you're obviously using Passion Hodge as a<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> extension. And, you know, apparently you sent that message last week to all my coworkers<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and myself on our aspects. A couple of us responded to Pash and Hodges, so we thought it was,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> we were mistaken, but we responded jokingly because obviously we took her message as a joke and then<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> you come back as a response, retaliating because you don't like our response. First of all, the message<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> that was sent on her extension was not having anything to do with work. It was a joke. We all took<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> it as a joke. A couple of us responded. You got my response. Now you're being hostile.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Don't respond to my message right now. Don't ever call my aspect again. And if you ever do,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm going to let Lynn Miller listen to your message. Thank you.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> I don't know who this message was directed to, but I think everyone in Pat Young's group got<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> the message. Don't know what it's about, but says anyway.<br>
    </li>

    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> Someone has signed on with your extension, 580, 580,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> and sending all kinds of inappropriate messages to all the TSRs.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> And, of course, it's coming out under your name.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> I know it's not you because it's a guy that's doing this.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> So please change your password.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> If you need help in doing that, give me a call back, and I can show you how.<br>
