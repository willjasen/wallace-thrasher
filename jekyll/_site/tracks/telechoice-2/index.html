    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Fashion, you really have to learn to watch your language. Thank you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Fashion, what kind of stupid messages are you sending at?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> If you can't even understand it, can't he say you're stupid and I think you're stupid too?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Passion, that's truly unoriginal.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Now what did he say? It sounded like he said soul to soul. This is Stephanie, I would like to know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I would like to see soul to soul, but I don't know exactly what they said.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I saved that message because that isn't original.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Please get back to me on 7-3-3. Thanks a lot. See you later. Bye.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I couldn't really understand it. It kind of scared me a little bit, but you should put that one on Halloween.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But I would like to know if you got a chance to see Chubrock when he was in Greeley, I'd like to know that too because he was here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Alright, see you later. Bye.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> They're very strange. Nobody used up the message to understand anything that that was about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm glad you'd no longer work in our reflection. Thank you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Thank you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Zuppy-Zuppy!
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Fashion, what was that? I don't even know what he said, if that was even a he.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Tell me. Bye.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Could you repeat that, please?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> This is Lorraine from SBS. We would appreciate it, and this is a business that we are calling on business people,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> and when we have messages we feel it's important to customers calling us.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Our phones are not to be played around, but please, you're going to send your messages for fun.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Do it to other sections. Do not do it to the SBS. Thank you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> What the heck was that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> My name is Chris Keller, and I'm getting your messages for passion.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> My extension is 644. I think maybe I think you're dialing the wrong number, or we have a mistake in the system,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> but passion's not here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> And, you know, again, if you want to talk to me about this, it's Extension 644.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Sorry about not passing the information on to you. Bye.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> What did you say, babe?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Passion's not at this number. My name is Chris Keller. I'm Extension 644.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> You're not reaching passion, you're reaching me. Thanks.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> I'll reach out and tell someone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> You're exactly right, Chris, because I'm getting the same messages, so I don't know what's the matter.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> I think it's picking it up from somewhere, but, like you said, passion isn't here,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> but there are some people getting upset about it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> In a way, you can't blame them, but they got to watch their mouth, too.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Before you be telling people they're stupid, you better make sure that you know that they're the ones not sending that message.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> You've got the wrong person, whoever you are, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Hey, if you're going to be sending messages to somebody, send it to only one person instead of everybody.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> What the hell are you talking about, because I have no clue, and I don't think you should be sending messages to people,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> but you have no clue what they're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hey, well, I don't know what sent the message. I don't know who's telling anyone they're stupid.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> That was a dumb remark.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Excuse me. I did not know who this is, but I did not tell anybody that they were stupid,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> and if you have something to say to me, please come to my desk and say it so that I know who you are. Thank you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Excuse me, who is this? You can go ahead and leave me a name, so I know who I sent it to, because I don't think I said it,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> so why don't you know what you're talking about before you call me first.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Okay? Thanks a lot. Bye.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Listen, I don't know who you are, but whoever you are, you're obviously using Passion Hodge's extension,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and, you know, apparently you sent that message last week to all my coworkers and myself on our aspects.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> A couple of us responded to Passion Hodge before we thought it was, we were mistaken,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> but we responded jokingly, because obviously we took her message as a joke,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and then you come back at the response, recaliating, because you don't like our response.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> First of all, the message that was sent on her extension was not having anything to do with work.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It was a joke. We all took it as a joke. A couple of us responded, you got my response.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Now you're being hostile. Don't respond to my message right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't ever call my aspect again, and if you ever do, I'll let Noah listen to your message. Thank you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> I don't know who this message was directed to, but I think everyone in Tat Young's group got the message.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> I don't know what it's about, but anyway...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> Hi Passion, Larry Luciano. I manage the aspect telecommunication switch.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> Passion, you should go ahead and definitely change your password. It's about ten after four.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> Someone has signed on with your extension, 580, 580, and sending all kinds of inappropriate messages to all the TSRs,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> and of course it's coming out under your name. I know it's not you because it's a guy that's doing this,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> so please change your password. If you need help in doing that, give me a call back and I can show you how.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> Thank you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_14:</strong> Hi, this is Pat Davalo from Training Room 1090C. Passion, we're getting some kind of weird messages over here that were sent from your telephone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_14:</strong> Will you please come over and see me? Thanks. Again, I'm in the Training Room 1090C. I think I know you. Come and see me right away. Bye.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Well, yeah, I didn't say anybody was stupid, but if you didn't, you know, can come over and talk to me about it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Not to leave me a message, you can come over and talk to me about it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Does that message to everybody in the center or is it to me directly?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, I don't know who sent this message, but it wasn't me. My name is Sherman Taylor and I'm over in Inbound.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Some had something new with a message about somebody passionate about something stupid or something like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm in Inbound in 304 and I appreciate it if you can give me a call that's straight into the situation now because I have no idea who sent it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I think whoever sent this message back definitely sent it in the wrong place.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So my name is Sherman. I'm in Inbound. 304, I just recently moved over here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So this 304 might have been someone else's aspect. So I appreciate it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> All I said was come again. I'd like to hear that so I can understand it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't remember telling anyone that they were stupid. I said that I would like to go see Chub Rock.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I thought that Passion had sent a message that some group was going to be playing Friday.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I distinctly remember the message. I don't remember calling anybody stupid. That's just not my makeup.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm sorry if you misunderstood, but that wasn't me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But the message that sent, I said it was scary. It sounded scary.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay. I don't know who you are, but I'm sending messages on Passion, Hodges, Ascension.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But anyway, I was interested in going to the event. I just couldn't understand the message.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And also don't send me any more negative messages you can't say anything tonight.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So don't call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> In response to your message, I don't remember calling anybody stupid
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> or sending any messages to anyone referring to them that way.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You might want to make sure you have your extension correct before you go reprimanding people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Who is that man? Because he ain't told nobody was stupid. Who is this putting me on my instant machine?
      <br>
