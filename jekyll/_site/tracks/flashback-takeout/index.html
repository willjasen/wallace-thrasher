      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No. So I can't really hear anything here. If you can put pineapple on the breadsticks
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and then triple that amount, whatever you normally put, just triple that and we can put that together
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> with my pieces and put that together. Okay, I'm having a hard time hearing you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So right now I got a small pineapple pizza. Small pineapple pizza. Okay, you got a small pineapple pizza.

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Now if you can take the breadsticks. If you have you have breadsticks, right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We have breadsticks. Yeah, if you can take the pineapple and triple with the normal portion,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you do put them on the breadsticks, put it together. That would be the best.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I can't hear you. Okay, so then what do you need me to repeat?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Um, so order of breadsticks? Yes. Yes. Just a regular order of breadsticks.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, regular breadsticks. Yeah, but if you took the pineapple, the like that you put on the pizza.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Is there any way you trip or multiply the normal portion that you would use and put it on the breadsticks?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That would be the best. But that would be good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's weird every time you, so once again, I'm sorry.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're like repeating every time I say something, you repeat that you can't hear.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're like repeating yourself or something. Can't really understand what you're saying.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Maybe there is a delay on both of our phones on both sides.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Can you do that with the breadstick? I really couldn't hear anything that you said with the breadsticks.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> With the pineapples. Like the same pineapple you put on the pizza?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know? Just put that on the breadstick and put it in a triple quantity that you put on the pizza.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Put it on the breadsticks instead of that. We can't put pineapples on the breadsticks.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You want to make a pepperoni on the breadsticks instead? Maybe it's a custom order.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know. I don't have a copy of your menu.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We can do pineapples on here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, if you put the cheese on the pineapples on the breadsticks, that would be good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I know you're particular. It's what I'm hearing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're particular about the way you do that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So, scratch the breadstick.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Take the cheese stick and put the triple pineapple instead of the pepperoni on the breadsticks.
      <br>
    </li>
