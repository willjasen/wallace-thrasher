      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello, George. Hi, I'm Remington from CitySearch.com and I'm calling to extend the offer to you and your business.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's negative comment reversal where we can actually reverse negative comments made about your establishment and it's costing you just a grand total of $1,300.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'll be okay, buddy. I'm not interested. I just need a credit card number from you. I said, I'm okay. I'm not interested.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But this is negativity about your company. Well, if somebody's going to write something negative about me anyway, they can kiss my ass anyways.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> They're going to do the night over to me. Money order or check?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What part are you not listening to? I don't care if they can put negatives over that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> CitySearch.com. I mean, you're going to get cyber bullied? No, I'm okay. Keep me good cyber bullied, huh? I'm okay. I'll be okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> There's three comments, sir. I understand. And I'm okay. You don't want to rectify things, huh? No, I'm okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This is plugged out of today's headlines is what it is. That'll be okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello, George. Yes, this is Remington and I'd just like to set you up on an installment plan.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, I'll be okay, buddy. Why don't we send a rep over and pick a checkup? Kiss my ass.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> The changes take effect within 24 hours. I don't care. How many are in it anyway, so it doesn't matter.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You got a bogus webpage or? No, I'm okay. What if I left negative comment on you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, then go ahead, but that's not very business-like. If you're trying to get my business in you, you're probably going to put something negative.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That makes no sense at all. Why don't you just compromise? It's all about compromise.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're starting to get my nerves out, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello, George. Hello, this is Remington. Look, I know you've looked at my profile.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've never seen your profile. I've got so much proof. What do you want?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You've left negative remarks about me. I've made a remark about you. I've known even who you are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> How did you get my password? I don't have your password. I don't know what you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> When you get down here and you back it up, Dennis, you got some negative profile in to do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Buddy, so you're something to favor. Don't call me back. Get down here and you back it up right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know how bad that is. How old can you be here, bud?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know what the fuck you're at. What are you? In Yada. Oh, I'm not trying to know this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Especially if you feel some crazy idiot like you? Nah. You're crazy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> George, your negative reviews are just heating up over here. I don't give a shit.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Do you think like medications, just gets when you've got to take your puck medication to it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Because they get it because you get on my nerves. This is unprofessional.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're telling me. Stop calling me. I'm a webmaster. Do you know what that means?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to call the cops. If I haven't pulled the trace. I told you, stop calling me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Stop calling me, please. I need a wire transfer to settle it up. There's no wire transfer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> There's nothing. I'm going to call the cops. I'm going to have them trace you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've got to code it to me here. And then, since they're also my friends, because I used to be a cop,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to have them come and find you. I've got to code it to me here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't give a shit. I'm going to put you on the phone with my team leader here at CitySearch.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And we can clean things up now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't need your services.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You and him can intersect here and see how you like it, all right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, I'll be okay. His name's Pico.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And you're going to get on the phone and explain to him, okay, where our payment is?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm on nine right now, George. I don't want to have to go to ten on you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I have absolutely no idea what the hell you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Work it out now. Get the negative remarks deleted.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're fucking schizophrenic. You need to take your medicine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I have so much evidence that you use my password that I'm going to turn over.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Let me get Pico on the line.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Whoopee going. How are you going to react?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Go ahead. Just a second now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I was trained in Fruitland.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I got a quarter to me.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
