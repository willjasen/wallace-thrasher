      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Thank you for nine games.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We can buy more of the proper words credit card.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This is William speaking.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> How about you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, William.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I came in there and I rented Halo for my game system, right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You with me there?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> William.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, and this disc kept popping out and my controller was not responding.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I was conquering all kinds of stuff,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> but it wasn't reflected in my score.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I just think this game was bunk.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I figure I'm going to need triple my rental feedback.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> We don't get it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We only sell again.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, I'm going to need triple my chair refunded to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I figured just from aggravation in time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, sorry, we don't do that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you have broken up on the disc, we bring it back and we'll swap it out for you, but that's all we do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, there's a big problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Huge problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Major problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, one of the problem in the disc, bring it back and we swap it out for you, and we'll take it every point.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Man, I'm telling you, I defeated this guy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Another guy, I defeated people left and right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But my score stayed at zero.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> at O?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Don't even know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're talking about your Xbox Live?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Achieve it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's a heck of an achievement.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Your game you sold me says, oh, on the score.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, man, there's a problem with the game.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Bring it back.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We'll swap it out for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to swap out back of my hand here if I don't get some satisfaction.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know what?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You can bring it back.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We'll take care of it for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We'll swap out the game.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But you know what?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Do not threaten me like that again.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And you know what?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You have a nice thing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Who do I need to talk to up there?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Thank you for going to game stuff.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We can buy more with the proper words credit cards.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This is William's speaking hug out of you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, who am I talking to, up her?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's me again, and you know what?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I told you, come on down with the game.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We'll swap it out for you, but your behavior is just threatening now to come bound in his backhand.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Smack me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know what?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Kill life.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Next time, if you come down and we'll deal with it,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and you'll have the cops here, too, and we can have a nice discussion with that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to swap out your teeth.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Thank you for going to game stuff.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We can buy more with the proper awards credit cards.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This is William's sticking hug out of you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Look at here, bunghole.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> You know what? I've already told you what we can do. You've already threatened to come down and
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> backhand us. You know what? That is unacceptable. That is immature. I am not going to deal
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> with you, sir. I will take care of the game if there's a problem with that, but that's all
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> we're doing, and stop calling because you're now harassing us, and I've already contacted
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> the police. So, you know what, I've already tracked your number and it's recording this to them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So, you know what? Keep it up. And the house will have a nice little chat with you eventually.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know what? Have a nice day, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Thank you for going game, stop. We can buy more of that power for credit cards. This is you get
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> for help you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're ready to feel my freaking grip once I come up, Eric?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't really care. How's that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Straighten this out here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, no, I think that there's some sort of issue with you, perhaps.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Maybe you should calm down a little bit. I don't think that you need to be making any sort of threats.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I've got a copy of Halo here, and this cartridge is all screwed up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm sorry, cartridge?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Halo was never on a cartridge. I think you're confused.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're going to be confused once I come up and settle to score.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> How's that on?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> What?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Seriously. What do you imply? Say it straight. Go play it right out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This defective Halo I got here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So what is defective? You said a cartridge for Halo?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> The score reads, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, after I defeated everybody in sight.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, what does that have to do with us? That would be a software issue.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> If you're having an issue with your console, I would suggest calling Microsoft.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Is that clear enough for you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Was my answer clear enough for you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> How about you feel my grip? How's that sound?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm sorry, what does that mean?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Do you have a problem holding something?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to grip your lips.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Are you making a threat?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Be a little more eloquent in what you're trying to say instead of making veiled threats.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to ring your freaking neck. That's what I'm going to do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay. Well, what we're going to do is we're going to call the police right now, and there's going to be a report filed against you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> How's that one for you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What do you mean by that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't know. Do you understand English? Does that not make sense to you if we call the police and file a report against you because you're making threats?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to ring your freaking neck if you don't give me what a need.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> What is your problem?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I want triple my purchase price refunded to me today.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm sorry, blackmail there's a work, buddy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We already know about you. We've already heard. You called yesterday and pulled this stuff.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just give me the manager there, tough guy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I am the manager, so that's it. You're done. You hear me?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You want to call and make threats? I will be calling the police and filing a report right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You want to call back? I'll make sure that they're aware of it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Don't do that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Why wouldn't I do that? You just made a threat.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'll come up and settle it one-on-one there, smart guy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, no. Really? Is that what you're going to do? Because it's fine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Let me know when you're going to be here because I will have a police officer waiting for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I played Halo for 90 minutes and my score reads, oh, oh, oh. This thing's defective.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You've already made threats, which means that this conversation is being civil or us taking care of your problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's done. It's no one's void.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're going to feel my foot. That's the way it's going to go down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm going to feel your foot.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Please tell me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> me when you'll be here, I will have a police officer waiting so that we can have this
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> taken care of so that they can arrest you for making physical threats over the phone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> 10, 15 minutes from now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay. I'll be waiting here for you. I'll see you in 15 minutes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to bring my joystick and wrap it around your freaking neck.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Not a problem. Not a problem at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You are absolutely hilariously idiotic.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Not a problem at all. I'll take care of you and then I'll settle the score. That's what I'm
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> going to do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'll settle what score. You've been making this whole thing up the entire.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> time you were talking about halos and you talked about a cartridge, you can't keep your story
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> straight. So if you can give me a straight story, maybe I could have helped you, but instead,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> it is resorted to making threats about hitting people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to pull your frickin' teeth out, one by one. How's that sound tonight?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, that sounds wonderful.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Do you have any other, like, dentistry that you like to try to do on me today?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, I think you'll be done after that. You'll be toast.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'll be toast. You're going to put me in your toaster as well?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why don't you shut your trap?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, I'm sorry. You were the one that was done.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You're trying to be smart with this, and hilarious.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'll leave my trap wide open at this point.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just give me your manager.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I told you. I am the manager.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't believe you, first of all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, too bad.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> The truth is, I am the manager on duty, and I'm the highest authority that you can speak to right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And in fact, you're on speakerphone for the other people who are working in the store right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hmm.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I'm going to take my elbow to your rib cage, and then you'll be the lowest employee when you're laying on the freaking ground.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Gosh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> This has started off.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> as something about a broken halo game, and then you directly moved to making physical threats.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> When I told you that I didn't understand what the issue that you were talking about, you said it was reading zero, zero, zero across the board.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That sounds like a software issue, which is not something that I would be able to help you with.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> In fact, I don't even know what you mean by that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to break your ribs.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> One by one.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Until you give me triple my money back.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Until your impudent little threat stop, there's not going to be actually anything that's going to be happening.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Quit wasting my time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, I think you're wasting my time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Although, actually, you've made my day pretty hilarious.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Buddy, just put your regional manager on the phone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> There's not going to be any escalations because, see, this is how it works in the state of California.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> When you make a verbal threat or you harass an employee of a store, we are no longer legally obligated to deal with your garbage.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So if you call back, we will, actually, it won't even matter because when you do call back, it will be busy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Because I'm going to have a phone off the hook because I'm going to be talking to the police department.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And I'm going to be filing a complaint against you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Trust me, I'm calling.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> When I hang up here, I'm going to be calling the police department.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, you're going to be in fantasy land once I knock you out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, my gosh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> The only reason why I'm continuing to talk to is because I find it hilarious.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But at this point, the same repetition of the most idiotic statements has gotten boring.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So goodbye.
      <br>
    </li>
