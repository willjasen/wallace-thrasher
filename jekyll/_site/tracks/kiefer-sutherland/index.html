      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's a big cluster of parcels we've got.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And just wanted to know when you're going to be around.

    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't need your address.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I need to know what address you are trying to deliver the packages.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This thing is COD.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We've been out there twice.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Then it's not to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It says it's for Mr. Sutherlander and...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I afforded nothing C.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and it's not for me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's from the Ho-Ho House.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And it's Plaster of Paris.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Now, what plaster of Paris is, is a compound?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I know what's Plesser of Paris is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not paying for anything C-R-D and I have not ordered anything, so...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, our driver is coming back en route to you with an interpreter.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> He is English as a second language.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> He's Bangladeshi.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I just need to see some identification when he gets thorough.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Again, I'm not going to be here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I can't express to you strongly enough.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I ordered nothing, and I am not accepting anything C-R-D.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, what Plaster of Paris is, it's a compound.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It can't dry.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It has to be contained.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I know what Plaster of Paris is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> They send it back to whoever sent it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Sir, I did not order it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've got your signature.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've got your digital signature.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You do not have my signature, and you do not have my digital signature, because I don't have a computer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's impossible.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Give me the name of whoever I can call that is above you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's from the Ho-ho House, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't care.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know what that is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And you're telling me, I'm accepting a project COD, and that's just not true.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have never signed nor ordered for anything like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You cannot give me the address where I live, so clearly it's not coming to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've given you the address.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I'm telling you, I don't know what that address is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's not where we're located.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's where we're located.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We've been here for 32 years at the same location.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's where you were located.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If someone was sending me something and they knew me, they'd be sending it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and my address.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So I'm telling you, send it back to whoever said to you, it is not mine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's yours.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You can pick it up from our dock, if you'd prefer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not picking anything up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I didn't order anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's not for me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Check or credit card required.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So if you could bring that with you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not doing any such thing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You can send the package back, but I did not order it, nor is it mine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm a regional manager.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Plaster of Paris is what the contents are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm looking right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't care.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm telling you, someone has sent you something that I have nothing to do with, nor do I want.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm looking right at the packing slip.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And you can't tell me my address or my name.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I work as an actor.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I am relatively famous.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I cannot tell you who sent this to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It has nothing to do with me as all I'm trying to help you out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So this is an act, you're saying.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> How do you want us to proceed?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's my question.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hello?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes, this is a story.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Weenie with UPS.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, and I said, I'm not
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> picking up the package. I did not order it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I said, have a great day.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What's the trouble out there?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I didn't order it. I have no idea what you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I did not ask anything. I don't know what the whole whole house is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't need a secondary language interpreter to explain to me what it is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I'm certainly not paying for something that it's not mine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's why I'm calling.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm a statewide manager for United Parcel Service.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You were a regional manager two seconds ago, but okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That was my associate. I'm the manager here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. And my name is Kiefer Sutherland, and people send stuff all the time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have not ordered this. I do not want it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I have been told by our vice president we can take PayPal.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not paying you anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, what is the holdup here? You said you're putting on an act of some kind.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Send it back to whoever sent it to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Are you putting on an act of some kind, is what I've been told.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's why the interpreters involved.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sir, do you want to pick it up or have a delivered?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I do not want it either.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I do not want either.
      <br>
