        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You can't even give me a building that I was in that had an elevator.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, they got returned to sender, sir.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> How can it give you return to sender if I'd never received it?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, that's the problem.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Work it out with your substation of your post office.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Who knows what else you're not receiving.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And then you decide to get in the elevator, go out.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> up, go down, whatever you were doing, and you pressed in excess of four buttons.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's pouring the thing out double, triple time of what it should be.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> The only building that I can ever think of that is on Indiana Avenue, which would have a<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> elevator in it, would have been the courthouse in Kentucky Key.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, okay. Well, then that's 89 times two. That would be 198 today.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I appreciate your being forthright about this.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So just read us the credit card number, we'll wipe it out, and in the future, just press the one button, boom, we're done.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, first of all, I'm not going to pay for anything if I haven't seen a bill that says I was there.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay, well, that's between you and the post office.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, no, that's between you and me, because you're saying you sent it, I've never seen anything from an Otis elevator.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm telling you, the only building on Indiana Avenue that would have such a thing,<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> is the courthouse, and if I'm in an elevator, I'm only pressing one button.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> More like five or six, according to our video tape.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, why don't you send me a copy of your video so I can either confirm or deny this?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Because that's private property. It's part of the city.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, then you send me a fucking bill or a picture from your video that says I was there,<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> so I can either confirm or deny that I was there, and I'm telling you, between the second<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and the 12th, my ass was sitting in my apartment.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, there's nothing to deny, and we've got audio as well.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, but see, you're saying you have it.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm disputing your claim that you have it because I've never seen anything from you.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, sir, you were hooting and hollering in this elevator.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm hooded and hollering in the elevator?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yes, sir.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And that's the reason why we instituted this $89 penalty is to dissuade folks from going bulk wild.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay, so that's.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> First of all, I would not hoot and holler in an elevator.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I was raised better than that.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Now, can you tell me what I was doing?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Obviously, you've seen the video.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, you were spinning around.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> The people were going buck wild.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Um, no, that's not me.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I've been here four years.<br>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Hell, burn it on a DVD, because I've never received anything from a notice elevator.<br>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> The only thing would have been unpleasant for you to see it of anything in me doing an elevator<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> would be fucking a woman.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Which I haven't done in years, and I wouldn't have done it in Kentucky Key County,<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> because the elevators don't go that far.<br>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, like I said, you're making stuff up because that's not anything I would do in an elevator.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're not getting shit until you can generate proof, which I doubt you can do.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, I've got the proof right here in my video machine.<br>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> There's no two ways about that.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Just a matter if I have to see you in the courtroom or not.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Sir, quit dinsen around the subject, and just read the credit card number and the expiration date.<br>

        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You want a credit card number. Here you go.<br>
      </li>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I've never heard of your company, so you're going to try to get my banking information<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> so you can go fund Al-Qaeda or ISIS or wherever to fuck you're funding at this particular moment.<br>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> to get anything until I get something. I talked to my lawyer, and my lawyer would like to see a copy<br>

        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> of this alleged video of me acting like an idiot in an elevator.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's indecent for presentation. So just make the checkout to Otis Elevator.<br>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No. Because if you actually were Otis Elevator, you would show up on my caller ID as Otis Elevator, not Mummy Napkin.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> My notes say Buckwild, Druel, and Hogwild. What am I supposed to do with that?<br>
