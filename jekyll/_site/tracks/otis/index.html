      <strong>None:</strong> Hello?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Time to talk to Scott.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> This is...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Hi, this is Haywood with Otis Elevators.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Got some mail return that we had sent to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I guess you didn't see it from Otis Elevators.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We had actually sent you a bill.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> There's a fee associated with our elevators,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> but anyone presses more than four buttons at once.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You were on surveillance.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> There's an $89 fee associated with that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's what we're trying to collect here today.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> When was this?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> January.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> January?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yes, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't remember being in an elevator back in January.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It was Hobby Avenue or Indiana Avenue.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> One of our buildings there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> If you just wanted to do the credit card by phone
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> or a routing number by phone,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> we could satisfy the debt that way.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> An elevator over on Hobby Avenue?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yes, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What's the building?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It was a city building.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It was an $89 fee.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's just to prevent people from pushing buttons
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> willy-nilly and...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Elevators are not to be toyed with.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It was the reasoning behind the fee.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What was the date of this?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> January?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Two through the 12th.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We were doing a big sweep.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So within that 10-day time for answer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You push too many buttons.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's the long and short of it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I'm trying to tell you,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't remember being in a building during that time train.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay, it's on video.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We've even got audio of that elevator ride that you took.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm with Otis Elevators.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay, I've been here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, I don't remember being in an elevator on Indiana Avenue.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Four years I've been here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay, we've seen lots and lots of elevators go up and down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And people are pushing too many buttons.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's wearing the things out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> This is what you did.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And this is what we need, $89.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I check the middle every day,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and I've never received anything from an Otis Elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Uh-huh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You can't even give me a building that I was in that had an elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, they got returned to sender, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> How can they give you a return to sender if I'd never received it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, that's the problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Work it out with your substation of your post office.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Who knows what else you're not receiving.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And then you decide to get in the elevator, go up, go down, whatever you're doing,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and you press in excess of four buttons.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's wearing the thing out double, triple time of what it should be.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> There's only building that I can ever think of that is on Indiana Avenue
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> which would have a elevator in it within the courthouse and can't get key.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, then that's, uh, 89 times two.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That'd be 198 today.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I appreciate your being forthright about this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So, just read us the credit card number, we'll wipe it out,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and in the future, just press the one button, boom, we're done.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> First of all, I'm not going to pay for anything
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> if I haven't seen a building since I was there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, that's between you and the post office, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, no, that's between you and me because you're saying,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> you said that I've never seen anything from an Otis elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm telling you, the only building on Indiana Avenue
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> that would have such a thing is the courthouse,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and in a fine-minute elevator, I'm only pressing one button.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> More like five or six, according to our videotape.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, why don't you send me a copy of your video
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> so I can either confirm or deny this?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Because that's part of the property.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's part of the city.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, then you send me a fucking bill
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> or a picture from your video that says I was there,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> so I can either confirm or deny that I was there,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and I'm telling you, between the second and the 12,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> my ass was sitting in my apartment.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, there's nothing to deny, and we've got audio as well.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, but see, you're seeing you have it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm disputing your claim that you have it,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> because I've never seen anything from you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, sir, you were hooting and hollering in this elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm hooting and hollering in the elevator?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yes, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And that's the reason why we instituted this $89 penalty
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> is to dissuade folks from going buck wild.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay, so that's the...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> First of all, I would not hooting hollering in an elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I was raised better than that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Now, can you tell me what I was doing?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Obviously, you've seen the video.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, you were spinning around?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> The people were going buck wild.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Um, no, that's not me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I've been here four years.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I have.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I've seen it all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I really have.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I would never do no such thing in an elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, there was saliva on the ground?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Trust me, there was a lot going on.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, first, you're making this shit up,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> because I would not do anything like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Sir, we have video.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We have audio.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I've seen...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Then show it to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Private property.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's city property.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, then it's my word of case yours.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Now, you say I've done this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm hooting hollering.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm slobbering on the ground.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm telling you, I didn't,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> because between January 2nd and January 12th,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I was home.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Now, you can't give me an exact date.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> All you're giving me is a 10-day window.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're not telling me what type of a building I'm even in
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> for this to happen.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're telling me all this outlandish stuff,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> which is not me to begin with.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So, until I see some proof from you,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> you're not getting a fucking dime for me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> This is non-compliance, right here as what this is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And there's a surcharge for that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> To the tune of 69 additional dollars.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We can keep going.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's your call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And I'm telling you,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> until I see some type of proof to your claims,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> you're not getting anything from me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Just read the credit card number and we'll just put it behind it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're not getting a credit card until I get proof, buddy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I've got the proof right here in my opinion.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And you show me the fucking proof,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> because all I have is your word
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> that such a thing has happened.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, you're just joy riding.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's what you're doing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> During that timeframe,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I really didn't leave my house that much
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> unless it was to go get groceries.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Not safe.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I have lived in Cancochee for 44 fucking years.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> There is no grocery store on Indiana Avenue.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Can you just read us the routing number?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're not getting anything until I get fucking proof.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So stop trying to get me on money on shit that I didn't do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Or cash.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What part of you're not getting a dime until I get proof?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Do you even understand?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I could send you an MP3 of the audio of you spinning around,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> whooping it up, acting inappropriate.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But you're not going to like what you hear
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> any more than I did, to be frank.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Help, party on a DVD,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> because I've never received anything from an odus elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Burn a DVD.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> This whole incident has burned into my memory.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's unpleasant.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You know what you think would have been unpleasant for you
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> to see an amazing need doing an elevator would be fucking a woman.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Which I haven't done in years, and I wouldn't have done it in Cancochee County
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> because the elevator don't go that far.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You're out of control.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You are?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, okay, apparently I'm out of control on someone who has generated
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> probably a pretty good scam to get people to give them their bank account numbers
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> so that they can drain them out of their accounts.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're buck wild.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're buck wild.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What you are?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And it's far out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, like I said, you're making stuff up because that's not anything
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I would do in an elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're not getting shit until you can generate proof,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> which I doubt you can do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, I've got the proof right here in my video machine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So you say, but like I keep telling you,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I've never heard of your company.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We have been in business for 117 years.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> My good man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And apparently in 117 years,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm the worst person that has been in your elevator system.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Again, you read just the routing number,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> we'll let it go, and I'm not going to hold anything against you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's how big of a guy I am, all right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Like I said, you show me proof that I did what you said I did in your elevator
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and you might get some money.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I'm getting the money, period.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> There's no two ways about that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Just a matter if I have to see in the courtroom or not.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Sir, quit dancing around the subject and just read the credit card number
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and the expiration date.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You want a credit card number?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Here you go.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Zero, zero, zero.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Zero, zero, zero.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's all zeros because you're not getting a fucking number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You tell me what building I'm in,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and you put screenshots of what the fuck I'm doing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And then I'll take it to my lawyer to see if it's real or not.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, it's beyond real.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What I'm looking at.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I've never heard of your company,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> so you're going to try to get my banking information
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> so you can go fund Al-Qaeda or ISIS or whatever the fuck you're funding
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> at this particular moment.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You can be funding your mom's drug habit.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't fucking know at this moment.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But until I get all of that, you're not getting a fucking dime.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Hello?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Oh, yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> This is Ray Ray with Otis Elevators calling, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I've never received anything from you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Like I said before, when you called,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> you're not going to get anything until I get something.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I talked to my lawyer and my lawyer would like to see a copy of this alleged video
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> of me acting like an idiot in an elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's indecent for presentation.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So just make the check out to Otis Elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, you're not going to get anything until I get a bill and I get proof.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I'll give you time to get a pen.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's certainly no problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Because if you actually were Otis Elevator,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> you would show up on my caller ID as Otis Elevator,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> not Mummy Napkin.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> My notes say buck wild, drool, and hog wild.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> What am I supposed to do with that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, well, hey, have you ever seen me at buck wild,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> the drool, and hog wild in an elevator?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't think we ever had an elevator.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, so right there, your claim is disputed right there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm going to put you through to my manager.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Are you going to try to shit again?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I can't get through to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You talked to my manager, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It might be a mob.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Hello?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Hold on.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, there's a dog speaking in the back room.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What office has a dog speaking in the background?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Huh?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yes, I'm shooting your claims here because I don't believe you're an actual company.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I believe you're trying to scam me out of money.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Where are you calling?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Actually, you called me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I did.
      <br>
    </li>
