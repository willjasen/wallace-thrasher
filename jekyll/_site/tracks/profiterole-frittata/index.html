      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, I came in there and I had some barbecued chicken and this stuff just tasted sulfuric.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You know one of those sulfur baths that you get into, this stuff was real strange.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So did you order it just recently?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yes I did.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, it was bizarre.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So you know what I'd really like is like a profiterol frittata.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You guys come up with something like that and I'm happy to let the whole thing go.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You know what I mean?
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, I don't know what that is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know what you're saying.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, why don't you try listening up?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I had a weird experience in there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes, I hear that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm looking for the order and the computer so I can read prints of receipt.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I've got the receipt.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, I didn't.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, how am I supposed to know when you ordered it if you're not giving me any information?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You just said you ordered it, you didn't tell me when.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You didn't ask.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It was like somebody snuck it up and put a match into my chicken.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You know what I'm saying?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, I watched the cooks.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> They don't like matches in the food.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You could have fooled me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Why don't you just cook me a profiterol frittata to go and I'll just forgive the whole mess,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I would have to talk to the owner about it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, I talked to the owner.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> He said to just give a calling and that you'd cook up what I need.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, but we don't have that frittata, whatever you're saying.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Profiterol.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're saying that you want the frittata, we don't have that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's made out of profiterol.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's real, real good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes, but we don't have the ingredients.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We don't have that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You can only order what we have from the menu.
      <br>
