    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You know, one of those sulfur bass that you get into, this stuff was real strange, so...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Did you order it just recently?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yes, I did, miss.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All right, let me check through the recipes, hold on.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, it was bizarre.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So, you know, what I'd really like is like a proffoderal frittata.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, why don't you try listening up? I had a weird experience in there.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You just said you ordered it. You didn't tell me when.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
