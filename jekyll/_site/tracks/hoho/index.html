    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Yes, I was just telling the lady there.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I moved down the way from you guys about a week back and I've been seeing some stuff outside of your place there and I was just hoping to get it picked up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> If you want me to lend you a hand picking it up, I can help do that too.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Now tell me what house you're talking about.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I'm talking about your place.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> My uncle's on the police force here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> He's the one who gave me your number.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> He's got everybody's phone number.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> But I saw receptacles outside.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I saw a pile of grass that looks like a pile of sawdust six feet high, blowin' in the wind.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Let me explain to you where I live, okay?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> What street do you live on?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I just live right around the way from you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I'm not trying to get the police involved.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I just want to try to get it cleared up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> No, I think what I'm trying to tell you is I'm not... [stumbles] you have absolutely got the wrong house.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Oh, no.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Let me tell you where I live, okay?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I'm not trying to get the police up here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I just want to get it picked up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Well, you're not talking about the right house.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> is what I'm trying to tell you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I certainly am.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I gave the info to my uncle.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> He's on the force.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I don't care who you listen.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I don't care who you gave it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Let me tell you, ride by, I'll tell you what, ride by, by my house.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I'm not.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> What kind of car do I have?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Let me tell you something.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I saw a pile of sawdust six feet tall, blowin' wild.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I've never had sawdust at my house.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Don't you understand that?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Oh, well, maybe it's gone now blowin' away.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I have never had any sawdust.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Sir, I saw receptacles rollin' around.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I saw bags of grass or something or other stacked yay high.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Why is it so hard for you to understand?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Why is it hard for you to understand?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> What address is it?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Listen, this isn't a bunch of hocus pocus.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I live at 213 West 4th Avenue.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> You go by and see anything wrong with that house.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I saw plenty.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I just walked by forty five minutes ago.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I'm not trying to get the law involved.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> It's the best house on the street.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> If you look for neatness, why don't we just get it picked up?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Because there's absolutely nothing to pick up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Now I'll tell you what I think you're looking at.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> If you want to know what on earth is that is the house brick is what now is the house brick.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Charlie, I don't follow what you're saying.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> The house that you're talking about, what's it made out of?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Oh, it's made of stucco or something or other.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I'm not a construction worker.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> [laughs] That's not my house.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Charlie, I saw sawdust blowing wild.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Now, what do you want?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> My name's not Charlie.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I know that.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> My uncle gave me all your information.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Plain as day.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Well, why don't you tell me who your uncle is?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Yeah, well, my name's Hoho.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I'm new in town.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Well, Hoho, I was on the sheriff's department for thirty years, and I'm telling you, you have the wrong house.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Police Dispatcher 1:</strong> Hello, Rensselaer Police.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Can I help you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Police Dispatcher 1:</strong> Uh, this is the city of Rensselaer Police Department.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I have no... Listen, I've got a... I don't know what's going on, but let me tell you something real quick.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I don't even know if you're the police department or not, okay?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Police Dispatcher 1:</strong> Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> But I've got a... I've got a guy... Are you still there?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Police Dispatcher 1:</strong> Yeah, I'm here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I've got a guy on the phone calling me and saying that I've got sawdust all in my yard and he wants me to clean it up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> And he said his uncle told him where I lived.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> And then, you come on the phone, so I don't have a clue what's going on, but whatever it is, I sure would like- Is it?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Police Dispatcher 1:</strong> Yeah, I don't know what causes it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> What I'm trying to say is I can't- Do you have any idea what's going on, who's calling me and telling me that my house needs to be cleaned up on the outside?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Police Dispatcher 2:</strong> Police, can I help you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Did you hear that?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Hello?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Police Dispatcher 2:</strong> Police, can I help you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Yes, are you in Ramsour?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> What police department is this?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Police Dispatcher 2:</strong> I'm sorry?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> What police department is this?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Police Dispatcher 2:</strong> This is Baton Rouge Police Department.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Where's that at?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> What state?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Police Dispatcher 2:</strong> Louisiana.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I'm going to try to explain to you real quick what's happened, okay?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I got a call, and the guy's called my name, and he said he got my address from his uncle who's on the police department.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> This is the craziest call I've ever heard.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> So he's saying, your house needs to be cleaned up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I just moved down, down the street and I just wish you'd get it cleaned up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I have no clue what he's talking about.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I got the cleanest house on the street, but here's where it's funny.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> So he keeps talking and all of a sudden another police department gets on the phone and says, police department, may I help you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Well, it's a police department in North Carolina.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Then as he's talking and no one comes on and says, this is you, police department, it switches from police department to police department.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> So I can't figure out what's going on.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Monty, can you hear me?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Yeah, I can hear you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> This is Hoho.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> All right>
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Let's put our heads together and clean it up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> You got it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Um, no, I don't have it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I'm not paying attention.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Come on.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> If you want me to get a cleaner, I can send you the bill.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> You don't have to lift a finger if that's what you're worried about.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Whatever you want to do.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> I'm not having anything to do with you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Charlie, you're living in La La Land, is what you're doing.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> See, you need to understand who you're talking to.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> You go from a guy named Monty to a guy named Charlie.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> So who the hell do you want to talk to?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> I want to talk to you, Monty Myers.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> You can't even tell me what my house looks like.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> You don't even know what you're talking about, all right?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Don't you understand how stupid you are that you won't tell me what my house looks like?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>LPC:</strong> Do you want me to come down and get nimble with you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Well, come on.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Come on.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Monty:</strong> Boom, boom, boom, bye!
