    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Hello, Ball Crowl speaking.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes, sir.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm trying to find a way to cry more of my own natural tears and reduce dry eye.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I'm sorry, this is an office at the University of Minnesota.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I'm in the physics department.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Sure.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm just trying to increase tier production in my eyes, and I got your number from the operator.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Maybe they thought physiology.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I'm a physicist.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I don't know anything about it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I'm sorry.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I'm a solid-stake physicist.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I guess you don't know anything about optics, then, I take it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I know optics, as in optics for lasers and such.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm a Spalunker.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's probably what caused this whole deal.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I've got a seeing-eye falcon that I brought with me back from Dubai, and that kind of helps me a little bit.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But what can I do to produce more tears in my eyes?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah, because that sounds like a physiology question.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I mean, did they put you in context?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> with someone in the medical school?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> They told me to talk to you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> They said that you would be the person to, I mean, are your optics even clean, your own self, or are they
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> dirty?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> My optics are inside a laser cavity, but I don't work with anything that's wet.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> In essence, I'm trying to avoid water at all costs.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> My eyes are dry as a bone, frankly.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I don't know anything about eyes and tears or moisture.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> How do I cry,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> more of my own natural tears.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Except for putting drops in your eyes, I just wouldn't know.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> How about liquid helium?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Is that something I can make me try?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What do you think?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> What do you think?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> That will not solve your problem.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Why?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> It's a cryogenic fluid.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not trying to live forever.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm just trying to produce more tears.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I just can't do any more to help.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm trying to cry more of my own natural tears in an increased tear production.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What should I do?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know how to make people cry.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I need to make my eyes more tearful.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> That sounds awesome.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Maybe you should watch a bad movie.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Garlic might make you cry or onions.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Is there anything physical I can do?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Maybe you can wait yourself.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hit myself?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Sure, I don't know.

    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm trying to increase tear production.
    <br>
  </li>

    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What can you tell me?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>

    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I'm trying to find a way or I might have to move.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> We have too many people here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> They need to move out.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, can you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Can you make my eyes more tearful for me?
    <br>
