      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello. Oh hi. Yes. I'm Buster Cheeks. I was looking for an apartment. I was wondering
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> if you could please. Um, in Syracuse. Uh huh. Um, what size apartment are you looking
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> for? Hello. Hi there. Can you hear me? I, yeah, I have a bad phone connection in my
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> apartment. So what, what size apart, what size are you looking for? Well, I just want
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> to make sure it's going to be compatible. I do a lot of hopscotch. Uh, so I don't know
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> what that is. You know, you hop on the ground, left, left, right, left, right, right, right,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> left, right. A lot of hopping up and down with hopscotch. I want to make sure we're going
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> to be compatible with the room and the flooring and the layout. Yeah. You're going to jump
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> up, up and down on top of the other ten, that's said, they'll be annoyed. Well, maybe I could
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> be under them. Well, what size room? You know, I like to. Why are you looking
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> for a two bedroom apartment, a three bedroom apartment, a rooming house room, a one bedroom,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> a studio? I'm open. I tend to set a lot of booby traps, you know, for intruders and
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> stuff. So I want to make sure it's going to be a good fit, you know, compatibility wise.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So I can set my booby traps. You know, we don't have, we're filled up right now. Um,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> anything that we have is going to be available down the line. And I don't know when we're
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> going to be finished with the renovations. Renovations? Well, I don't need anything that
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> fancy. Um, I also have a lot of, huh? Hello. Hi, yeah, it's Buster. Do you think we could
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> talk about like a shared rooming kind of thing? Instead, I don't have anything available that
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> would work for you. Why is that? It sounds like you're going to bother the neighbors. I don't
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> have any ground floor units. You're going to bother the neighbors. No, you've got some sort of,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and I don't want my properties booby trapped. I'm sorry. You need to look elsewhere. I'm unable
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> to assist you. My main thing is that I house a lot of jumping beans in there. That's what I do for
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> work. So as long as we're okay on that, I think we could probably move forward. I think that you're,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you're, you're, you're, you're playing games with me. And man, I have no where to live. Well,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you should go to a shelter. I'm not a social service organization. I have the money so we can get
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> this done. I don't have any ground floor units of it. What, what part of this don't you understand?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't have any ground floor units available. I could be on a higher floor. No problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Jumping on top of people's heads. Jumping on top of my, you've already said that you jump up and
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> down and shuffle left and right. How about a big cast deposit? No, I'm not. I could give you some
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> jumping beans for you. I can only accept one month security. I'm not interested in having you as a
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> tenant. You've said that you jump up and down. You play hopscotch in your apartment. You put
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> up your apartment. All day long. And it's not about money. It's about creating successful
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> communities in which can live. And Buster, I think you're busting my chops. I'm not interested in
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> having you as a tenant. If you want to file a complaint with me, go ahead. A complaint. I don't
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> even know. I have no ground floor units for me. Do not call me again. What if I set a booby
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> trap for you? Free a charge. Protect yourself. I'm not interested in you. You don't call me again.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not interested in renting to you. I'm not interested in carrying on any more conversations
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> with you. Look, I'm going to send you a PayPal payment. Okay. And we can just get things started
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> that way. That's no problem at all. I don't have a PayPal account or Venmo, you know, whatever it takes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Fuck you. Get out of my life. Listen, I just need a place to live here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello. Hi, yes, this is Buster Cheeks. I did want to let you know I'm just dropping.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, fuck you. Get out of my life. I'm just going to bring you some references. Okay.
