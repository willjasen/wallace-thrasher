      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And when they opened the door, smoke, smoke.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Everywhere was smoke.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And he said, come on, Josh, have a cigarette.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, John said, no, I don't think I want a cigarette.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I understand.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> things are bad. Oh, come on, man, you can kick the habit. So,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Josh began to puff, puff down on a cigarette. And finally he said,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Woo! I feel good. So he went on back, went back home that night. But the
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> next day, he's right back down to Gap Mop Joe's house. But Gap Mock Joe said, I have
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> something better for you this time. And he put that needle in his arm and shot that medicine in
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> him. And he said, whew, I feel good. Went on back home and his muddy, meadow mat and met him at the door
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and said, Josh, said, I understand you fool around with old Gap Mop Joe. So, Mother, you don't know
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> what you're talking about. But that night, late that night, he was in a bed along. He was real cold
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and sick. And he said, ooh, I'm so cold. I feel so bad. So sick, so bad. His mother heard him,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> ran upstairs. When she said to him, she said, Josh, he hadn't been fooling around with that dope, have you, boy?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> He saw her mother let me alone. They took off. Went on back, back down the old gap mouth joke.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Back and forth, back and forth. And finally he was broke. Didn't have any more money. So he said to
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> himself, I got to get me some money. I got to have me some money. I'm
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Got to get that dope. He saw an old lady walking along one lonely dark night.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Picked up a stick, sneaked up behind her, hit across the head. But doom, bip bop, bit bop,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> went to kick in and stuffling her. And found the old lady was dead, stone dead. So he ran on back
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> the gap in my Joe's house, fell on the couch again with that medicine in his own.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Woo! I feel good. But a few days later, he was in the cell, in the jail cell. And there he was
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> all along. And he began to think to himself.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And he said, I should have listened to my mama. I should have listened to my mama.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All of my money is gone. All of my $2,000 would I work so hard for. All of it is gone. All of it is gone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I want my mama. Somebody, please help me. Mama. Mama, please help me. I feel so cold. I'm so sick.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know what I'm going to do. Look like I'm going to die.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And finally he fell to the floor. He was dead.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Gone dead.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So you see, the evil dope made him turn his back on his dear mother.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> His dear girlfriend made a lie out of him, made a thief out of him, stopped them from going to college,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> lost his $2,000, made a murder out of him, and finally killed him.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Stone dead.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Stay away from marijuana and steal away from the evil needle.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Stay away from the evil dope.
