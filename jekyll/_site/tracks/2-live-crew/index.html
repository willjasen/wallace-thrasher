      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Joseph, he had listened to the ranks of Egypt so that he was the prime minister of Egypt next to the pharaoh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We'll tell you guys a story.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Anorama City, California, 911, 412.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh yeah, I think that things should be the answer. I don't think they should be unnecessarily brain.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know, I think the law should do something about people coming into the town and just saying whatever they please, especially to young people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Let's get some thoughts from John here in Lakewood.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Hi, John.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> How are you doing tonight?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> All right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, I don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> First of all, I think censorship in reality has just pretty much been beaten to death.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> With two-life crew, you know, they've got so many other things to worry about besides, you know, the heyday of the negative press they've been getting.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> They've got helium to worry about now, which is something, you know, that's something, you know,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> that's just opened up a whole new ballpark for them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Healium.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And now they've got, you know, mallets on stage.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You know, where are they going to stop?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's what my question is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah, I guess the next thing will be sacrificing human beings on stage.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, then you see, they'd be breaking the law.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Then that would be killing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, but, I mean, at this point, they've already begun to use helium.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I just don't see the validity in that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Do you have any insight on that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, using healing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> In what way?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> On stage.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I mean, how would they use helium?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You mean, they just...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You mean, they just...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And then they actually mount lambs.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> They saddle lambs on stage.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And I don't, you know, I don't see this as entertainment of any form.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I may be wrong.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I think it is true the cooler you are, the more willing you are to accept it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah, well, I guess it's in the eyes of the beholder, I suppose, as to what is art and what is
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> entertainment.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So, you know, if you don't like that kind of action.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You don't have to go see it, I guess.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But the lamb thing is what really strikes me as being kind of odd.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, if they're hurting the lamb, then perhaps animal cruelty charges can be filed.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, see, that's the thing, they're giving the helium to the lambs.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's where it's kind of like...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And you're talking about two-life crew?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And in the fact, I think it's part of this leg of the tour that's going to be through Denver.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, then perhaps that'll be slapped with a charge of cruelty to animals.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> If they can prove that helium is, you know, if giving helium to a lamb is harmful.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, and then they begin to use the mallets on the lamb.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't understand that one bit.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And at the very end, that is cruelty, and I would disagree with that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But I'm saying the performance of the music itself, there's no reason why we should censor it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Sure, absolutely.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But one thing, how do you feel about at the end of the show where they strike a gong with a lamb?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Now, I have never seen that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That is part of their life show.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and I don't think that's a viable thing for any artists to do at this point.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Man, I see, I didn't know that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You've enlightened me here, John.
