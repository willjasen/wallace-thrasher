    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hello?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, this is Harrison over at GameStop.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What are you doing here?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Over at GameStop?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, I'm here at GameStop on Leatsdale.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And we're looking for people to take part in the tournament.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We got the 4th of July to pay everybody at $250.

    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Everyone who interests gets $250.
    <br>

    <br>
  </li>

    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay, cash money.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, July 4th from 1 PM to 5 PM.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Here on Leatsdale Road,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I was wondering if you knew anybody who we could recruit,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> get them signed up and get planned.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I do, I do.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You do? Oh, okay. Are you any good?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, yeah, I'm really good. I'm really excited to go.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> All right.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Let's see how much do you weigh?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Probably about $140.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Now, I wanted to make sure you're going to fit and make sure where you're going to sit.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> What's going on with your voice there?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> My voice, I can't take part because I work here. I'm excluded.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Is that what you mean?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, okay. So you can't play the games.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not allowed because I'm an employee. Is that what you're asking?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Because if I did, no offense, you wouldn't stand a chance against me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, I think I'd put you down real quick.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, you ever heard of Counter-Strike?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, I'm probably the best in the country, the best player.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, I'm the top player.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm the top player in Counter-Strike. Yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm sorry. I'm not comparing to me. You're not.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But you don't have to worry because I'm a global elite.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm a global elite.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, that's fine. I've got people offering me thousands of dollars for tips and secrets.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I don't think you'd really compare air, but don't worry because you're not playing in me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're playing other people. Do you understand?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's why I say you wouldn't last more in a couple minutes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You'd be defeated. You'd be destroyed.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If I were playing it...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Who, me?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Is it a Counter-Strike tournament?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, I'd become, I would win. I'd come on top.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What makes you say that?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm a global elite, okay? Do you know what that is?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't think you know what it is. I'm the top player in Counter-Strike. I'm the top.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, we've never engaged in combat. If we did, you'd be taking down several notches.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> If I engaged in combat with you, I wouldn't tap your ass, but across the mat.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm number one. I just am. I slay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Any opponent, slate. Any challenger, slate.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm a slayer, and that's what you need to remember.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Look, I thought this was about some tournament. What's going on here?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It is. But you're telling me that you're involved in elitism, and I don't know if that's the spirit of the tournament.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> The tournament is good-natured. I don't know if we want elitism, necessarily.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, you started it. You started talking on all this trash.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not going to talk strategy with you. That's cheating.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Because if I told you my strategy, you would have such a tremendous advantage that you would win the grand prize, which is the Dodge Neon.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> 2018 Dodge Neon.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay. Can you put me down for the tournament?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, I've got you down here. Can you say you weigh 240 pounds?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> 140. 140.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> 140 pounds, okay. And so you're intermediate and novice?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm a master.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I'm a global elite.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So versus me, you're an intermediate. That's what you're saying?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, see, I'd take you down. I'd take you out.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Every time. Every time you pop up on my screen, boom, annihilated. You're out.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm better than you. I'm trying to tell you that.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I would bring you to the depths so you'd be slayed, and then you'd brought down so far below the depths.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You'd be decimated by my skill and my advantage that I have.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's why I'm here. Who works at GameStop? Me or you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I guess you do.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's accurate.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Whoa.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's the first accurate thing that you said. And so you weighed 340, 240.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> 140.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> 140. Okay. We got some players who are very rotund, and you're a novice.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, that's okay. We take everybody.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm novice. I'm telling you I'm a master. I'm a global elite. Do you know what a global elite is?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Have you ever played Counter Strike before?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I thought you were good.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm beyond global elites, sir. I'm in the stratosphere.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You can't get past global elite.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm in the stratosphere here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're in the stratosphere?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, big time.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What the hell? What does that mean?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm the great annihilator.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So you're fortunate in that way that you don't have to face me as an opponent. It'd be total decimation.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I think you're fortunate that you don't have to face me, because I would destroy you, pal.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> In Counter Strike?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Huh? In Counter Strike?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, what's going on with your phone there?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I've told you before, I'm not eligible to be in the tournament.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I know. You've said that already.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But you keep asking me what's my story and what's up with me and you don't have to worry because you're not going to face me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm trying to explain.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, your voice, your voice, it's going up and down.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're just not prepared for me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's doing it again.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's doing it again.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You've never had to confront someone like me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I wear gloves. I wear pads. I get into it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I have gloves in game, okay?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Not like this. I get into it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I decimate my opponent.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I wear gloves. I wear goggles.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I wear a visor.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Guess what? I'm a fucking wrist player.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I wear goggles too. I wear the fucking gunners, the MLG gunners.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay. They fucking, they make you so you can, it's all zoomed in.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I can, I can see you before you see me, pal.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And then I'll deck you, deck you straight in the head, annihilated off my screen every time.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Your avatar would dissolve and disintegrate, facing me on the battlefield.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, no, no.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, no, no.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> What do you mean?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, no, you're wrong. You're wrong. I would, I would destroy you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I would decimate and pulverize and dissolve your avatar so quickly you wouldn't even register the score.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, no, no. See, my score is going to be higher.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm going to get more frags. I'm going to have frags you.
    <br>

    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And if we won B1, I would win.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm a wizard. I'm a sorcerer.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I, I'm, I'm going to win the tournament so you're speaking to the winner of the tournament right now.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And then I'm going to be coming to your door for a 1v1 money match. How does that sound?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's a if and when. That's a big if and a big win.
    <br>
  </li>

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And then we'll 1v1 and we'll see who's the real master at handshake, huh?
    <br>
  </li>

    <br>
  </li>

    <br>
  </li>
