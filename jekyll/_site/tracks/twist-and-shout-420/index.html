      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, I was trying to make my way up, Burr.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, I have, you need to give me a cross street or something.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have no, I've asked four people where you are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know where you are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I was holding for someone to get on the line and it went silent.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, I had you on hold.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Can you give me cross streets?
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Are you in the mountains?
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Are you downtown Denver?
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I apologize.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, that's fine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I just need to know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> where you are so I can kind of help you out here because I have four different people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No one knows what you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, you hit it smack dab on the head.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I live across the Great Divide.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know, I have the four acres and I'm in the fork.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Are you trying to get to Denver?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm trying to get to Twist and Shouts.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, we're in Denver.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Are you Twist and Shouts?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes, we are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> In Denver, Colorado.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Good, good, good, good, good, good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I've got the two large creeks running through the middle of my back.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, that's not, that doesn't help me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I need something else.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You need to give me the name of the city that you're in or something.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I can't help you unless I know where you are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> The campfire pits.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've got them on either side.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That doesn't help me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You've got to give me the name of the town you're in.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you just say campfire pits, that doesn't help me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Because the next thing I'm going to suggest is Google Maps.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I think you've hit it smack dab on the head.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> For the third time, yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What about the light rail?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I mean, that shows some real initiative on my part, don't you think?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes, it does.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You could take the light rail to either Loto or you could take it to Loto and you can take the 15 down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's one way to do it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But other than that, I really don't know where you are, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Are you talking about the real estate market that I get to see everything on the way?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Because it's hot right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Is that what you're saying?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Not at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't think we understand each other at all, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, no, no, no.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're just adding an addendum to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> my original question is what you're kind of doing, right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Not at all, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm just trying to help you, and I'm confused this out right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So we can try and take the light rail to the bus station.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's one way to do it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And you've got bobbleheads, yeah?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, we got bobblehead.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, well, I think I'm showing initiative here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's great, and I'll see when you get here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, so when I start out, which direction do I start out?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Depends on where you're starting from.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, I know, right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So you can either try Google Maps at this point, or you can check your phone, because I don't know where you're starting at.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> One thing you didn't mention, though, is how all the street signs are on the far side at the intersections,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> meaning you only discover the street you're looking for after it's kind of too late, you know?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's okay, yeah, but I'll see when you get here, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Are you on a service road?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We're on the largest street in the United States, the one that goes the longest from east to west.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You can't miss it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> My point is there's no way to turn around for at least a good three to five miles once you start out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And their service roads don't exist, so.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, well, I don't know that, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've got to go.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm the only one here, so good luck, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If something's blocking the road, I'm sunk.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know what I'm saying?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, you are, and I don't know how to help that, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We'll see when you get here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Listen to me.
