      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hello, I'm calling about the job about the job about cooking job positions. Yes. Oh, you're sorry to be told. Well, I'm good. Okay. So, can I send a resume? You can keep it on file. Sure. I'm sending over to
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> 170. That's down in California. 90240. Okay. Is it okay if I just bring the application in? Sure, you can bring it in. Okay. Okay. I got some different things I cook. I use a chafing dish. I have sterno. Maybe I could just bring it all and give you a little demonstration. How's that sound?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> The resume will be fine. Just the resume. You can go ahead and drop it off. Just the resume.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Would you accept a muffin at all just as a sample to get a feel for what I'm going to do? Sure, you got it for a big one. Okay. And
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I make those jungle juice stuff. It's real, real good. So maybe you can give that a try. Okay. What kind of hours are you looking for?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We work. We open at four. So we're late hours. The kitchen we usually done by 1230. I'm in the halfway house and I have to be back at 11. So, okay. Could we work that out somehow? Well, first of all, the position's already filled. So that would actually be something that would have to be done within the future if we do decide to go with anybody else. But I have quite a few people on the list. They're still waiting also. So you have to just jump off your resume and then I'll have it on file. And if anything, you're going to be able to do that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you have changes with these other applicants that I had already, then I'll have your information on file.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hey, I'm not a quitter. I'm in the halfway house, but I'm bound and determined partner. Okay. Okay, buddy. I got a journal. I got a chafing dish. I got all kinds of stuff I can heat up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. Well, we have all our equipment here. So, but just go ahead and send in or bring your resume.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm in the halfway house right now. Okay. Can't you help me out? Well, like I said, right now, I already have a lot of applicants that we've already went to and interviewed. So that ad was like a month old.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, let me give you a nacho and you could taste it and you can see that I've got what it takes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, if you're telling me you're going to bring me a nacho, you're going to remember my mom knows the kitchen. So you're going to be able to work.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And anybody that's working here is going to be working under my mom and I doubt that anybody makes better nachos in my mom or any kind of Mexican food like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But like I said, go ahead and send in your resume and I'll have it on file. And if anything changes with these other 35 applicants that I have on file, I'll have your application.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Are you just being macho or what? Am I being macho? Good. I love, but you know what? How about if you just forget about, do you ever doubt this level? Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I am saying your resume. Don't said your resume. Forget about it. This is not a place for you to be working.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hey, come on. Give me a shot.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hello.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hey, this is Troy with those nachos. What's going on, dude?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Uh, not much, but you know what? Your demeanor is not something that I would actually have as employees, so I'm not looking for anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're kind of a demeanor. You'll be working here in a family establishment.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I could barely hear you. You got a bad connection, but just try my nachos real quick.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Uh, I actually know. You know what? Like I told you before, like I said earlier, your demeanor is not something that would be acceptable here at a family restaurant.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Why? Especially, especially, especially a cop bar, because this is a cop bar. This is what we are here, all cops.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So, do you stuff a favor? Losers numbers don't ever call it again. Next time you call, it's going to be borderline harassment.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I would not like to, for me to wake up some of my buddies over here and make sure they trace this phone call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hey, hey, find out what this is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Cops love me. They love my muffins. Everything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, well, not here in this place. All right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, no.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Have a good day, buddy. It loses numbers. I'll call it again.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What number is this? So I can make sure.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'll call it again.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I can make sure I get rid of it. What is the number?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You don't know the number you're calling. Don't call it again.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What about my resume?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> The number you just dialed. Best number you need to avoid.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I could barely hear you, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What's your name again?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This is Troy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Troy, what is laughing?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm the best. What's the pay like?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What is the last name, Troy?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Wolf.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Wolf?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, Troy, Wolf. Do you stuff a favor?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm assuming you say you're from a halfway house, right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So that would mean probably that you don't have a cell phone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So this phone number that's coming up on my caller ID,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm assuming this is from your halfway house.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Correct?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So when you hang up, the next phone call that I'm going to be making
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> this to the halfway house and I'm going to be making a complaint to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Mr. Troy Wolf.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Or somebody else that's sitting there that's harassing this particular
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> telephone number that I'm calling.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And two, one, three numbers.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So you're thinking that you're somewhere in LA, correct?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So LAPD will be investigating and finding out, see who's calling
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> one of their bars and harassing the patrons here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
