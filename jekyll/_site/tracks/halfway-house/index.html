    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, first of all, the position's already filled, so that would actually be something<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> that would have to be dealt with in the future if we do decide to go with anybody else.<br>

    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But I have quite a few people on the list that are still waiting also, so you have to<br>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, like I said, right now, I already have a lot of applicants that we already went to an interview,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> so that ad was like a month old.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, let me give you a nacho, and you could taste it, and you can see that I've got what it takes.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, you're telling me you're going to bring me a nacho.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're going to remember when my mom runs the kitchen, so you're going to be...<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If anybody that's working here is going to be working under my mom,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and I doubt that anybody makes better nachos than my mom.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No more.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> like that. But, like I said, go ahead and send in your resume and I'll have it on file.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And if anything changes with these other 35 applicants that I have on file, I'll have your application.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Are you just being macho or what?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Am I being macho?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I love, but you know what? How about if you just forget about your dollar's number, okay?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm going to send your resume. Don't send your resume.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Don't send your resume, forget about it. This is not a place for you to be working at.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hey, come on. Give me a shot.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hey, this is Troy with those nachos. What's going on, dude?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Not much, but you know what? Your demeanor is not something that would actually have as an employee, so I'm not looking for anybody with your kind of demeanor to be working here at a family establishment.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I can barely hear you. You got a bad connection, but just try my nachos real quick.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Actually, no. You know what? Like I told you before, like I said earlier, your demeanor is not something that would be acceptable here at a family restaurant.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Especially a cop bar.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> this is a cop. This is what we are here. All cops. So, do these stuff in favor.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Lose his number? Don't never call it again. Next time you call it's going to be borderline harassment.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I would not like for me to wake up some of my buddies over here and make sure they trace this phone call.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hey, hey, I find out who this is.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Cops love me. They love my muffins, everything.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, well, I'm not here in this place. All right? Oh, no?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Have a good day, buddy. Lose his number. I'll call it again.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What number is this? So I can make sure I get rid of it. What is the number? So I can make sure I get rid of it.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What is the number?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know the number you're calling. Don't call it again.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What about my resume?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> The number you just dialed. That's the number you need to avoid.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I could barely hear you, man.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What is your name again?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This is Troy.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Troy. What is your last name?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm the best. What's the pay like?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What is your last name, Troy?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Wolf.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Wolf?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, Troy Wolf. Do yourself a favor.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm assuming you say you're from a halfway house, right?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Right.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So that would mean probably that you don't have a cell phone.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So this phone number that's coming up on my caller ID, I'm assuming this is from your halfway house.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's right.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Correct?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Right.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So when you hang up, the next phone call that I'm going to be making this to the halfway house,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and I'm going to be making a complaint to you.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Mr. Troy Wolf or somebody else that's sitting there that's harassing this particular telephone number that I'm calling.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And 213 numbers here, I'm thinking that you're somewhere in L.A.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Correct?<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
