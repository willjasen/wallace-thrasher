    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> If you get a bigger amplifier, that'll push your sound more forward.

      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And I got a parcel here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> It was returned to us.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You didn't answer the door on our three attempts.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Uh, what location were you trying to deliver at?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm, uh, from the artesian division.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm a manager, not a driver.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So I was going to ask when you're going to be there so we can send another driver out there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Which is why I'm asking you what location is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And that's why I'm asking you when you're going to answer the door.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't know what door to answer because I need to know what location you're talking.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> talking about. Okay, well, I'm not a driver for the second time. Okay, well, for the third
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> time, I don't know where you're trying to deliver the package to, so then we're not going to get
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> anywhere. I was going to let our driver know the appropriate time for you, but if you don't want to do
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> it that way, then you let me know how we should proceed with your parcel that you ordered.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Sound good, good, good. I'm not even aware of the parcel that was ordered, that I ordered, so.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I mean, I'm actually on a pay phone right now on my lunch break.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's cool.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It is pretty cool.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I go the extra mile.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's great.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So I just need to know, like, I don't even know what is, what's been ordered, like, what, apparently somebody wants to send me something.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Great.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I need to know the address.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Well, I mean, that's none of my concern, what you order, who you ordered from.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> That's not my job.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> My job is to take care of you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> your COD. And then we'll deliver it today within the next two-hour window.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Not a problem at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> 5309 is your total today.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> We accept Visa and Master Charge.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't know what you're getting at. I don't know why you need money.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I feel like I'm being scammed. I don't even think this is a real thing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Oh, it's beyond real. I've worked here for nine years.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> At UPS.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So I would get in gear and pay your bill.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Read me the long number on the card and we'll settle the fee and then we'll get you squared away.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Sound good, good, good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> fee for what now?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> It's a COD, cash on delivery.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> That means you ordered something that requires a payment.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> We use credit cards here at UPS to satisfy with those debts.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I never ordered anything like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You never ordered anything?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Nope.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But if you can call your driver and give me the address and the name and all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> that, then we can verify all this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But right now, it seems really sketchy, and I don't, I don't trust you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
