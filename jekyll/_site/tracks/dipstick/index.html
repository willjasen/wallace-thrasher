      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Hello?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yes, this is Veta Riquel with United Parcel Service.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Who am I speaking with?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> James Leefie.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yes, I've been having a difficulty delivering your parcel.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I just wanted to make sure someone's going to be around their dipsticks of some kind of General Motors.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And I'm a supervisor here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, to the best of my knowledge, I'm not waiting for a package from General Motors.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It says Dipsticks.com.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And you haven't returned any of our voice.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> We've left you, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay, I'm not expecting anything from General Motors.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's dipsticks.com, sir, and I believe I've stated that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> To the best of my knowledge, I'm not waiting for a package from dipstick.com.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> What address are they supposedly going to be delivering this to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Do I need to talk to somebody else, or are you the man of the house, or whom am I speaking to here?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I told you earlier.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> My name is James Leifie.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And as I said, I'm Federico with the United Parcel.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> service. I've been here for seven months here at UPS.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's fine. But what I'm trying to determine is whether or not I'm supposed to be the recipient
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> of this. The only, I'm not expecting anything in the automotive line, which I'm presuming
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> dipstick.com has something to do with. Either that or it's a pejorative phrase for something else,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> but I'm not going to worry about that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, you're the recipient. I can guarantee you that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I worked here long enough to determine that for myself.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't need to check with...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I'm just trying to determine whether this was supposed to be a delivery to my business or to my home.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, I've made the determination, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I haven't.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, no.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Dipsticks.com, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> If you can get in gear here and get the payment prepared, we can resolve this this evening and have it to you...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Sir, I honestly think that you should contact my lawyer because I've got nothing to do with anybody named
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Dickstick.com.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We've left three voicemails, fella.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, you have not. Not at this number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And you have not returned any of our messages, and you haven't responded...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Since I have not gotten them, I haven't returned any.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, I know you haven't returned it. I've left you a voicemail. I left you a slip on the door.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> At this number?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I haven't heard anything from you at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm northern at all. I don't know what the obstacle is, but, sir, can we resolve this today?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Is my question...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Certainly, if you'll tell me where you anticipate it being delivered.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What is the delivery address on the parcel?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I don't have it handy, sir. It's on the dock right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, well...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, no.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> If you don't have it, then perhaps you should try finding that, so I can determine if this is legitimate.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Sir, I've made the determination, as I said.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But I have not, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, let me just get the running number from your account, and then we'll get the payment handled.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> $486.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> you've been from... Sir, this is obviously a scam. You'll excuse me if I hang up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Thank you very much.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, I don't...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> University of Tennessee.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> This is Juan with UPS.com.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What appears to be the trouble today, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I have no idea. Someone called me and said that I had a package that was supposedly being delivered
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> from dipstick.com, and that I needed to line up the payment. I have never ordered anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> from any organization named dipstick.com.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I see.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I'm the administrator here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What did you order, and when were you...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I did not order anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You did not.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Apparently, you had a disagreement.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And all I was trying to determine
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> was what the delivery address was
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> on this hypothetical parcel
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> so that I could determine whether this had
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> to do with my work or my
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> personal business. And the
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> individual that was on the phone, who
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> sounds suspiciously like you,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> did not have any idea where it was supposed to be delivered, which seems very odd if you're United Parcel Service.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm an administrator here. I've been working...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't really care if you're Jesus arisen from the grave.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> If I can't determine that this is a valid delivery for me, I'm not going to accept it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And I don't understand anything about payment for something I have never ordered from an organization named dipstick.com.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I am the embodiment of God.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I am divinity and humanity combined.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, so you have a complaint, and I need a payment, and we need the best time to deliver.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Those are the three items on my agenda today, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> If we can get those resolved today, we'll be in good shape.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I haven't ordered anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So I am hardly going to pay for something that I haven't ordered.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh. Okay, you want to come pick it up, you're saying then.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I can give you our...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, I'm saying I did not order any item from any item from any...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> organization named dipstick.com, which is what the first party told me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, I can tell you, I've been here for many, many years. I've seen lots of parcels of all shapes and sizes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's fine, but I have not ordered anything. Okay, and then you want to come pick it up?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, I want nothing to do with it in any way, shape, or form.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, why don't I come out there myself, get you familiarize?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Sure.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Where are you supposed to be coming?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I am in the administrative office.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And where are you supposed to be coming?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Where is the package supposedly to be delivered?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's a residential delivery, sir. I can promise you that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And to what address?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's a residential address, and I've got no problem bringing that to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Myself, I want to resolve this here today at UPS.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> How about this?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yes, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Why don't you give me your extension?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
