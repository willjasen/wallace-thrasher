    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Hello?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yes, this is Veda Viquel, with United Parcel Service.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Who am I speaking with?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> James Leafy.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yes, I've been having a difficulty delivering your parcel.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Just wanted to make sure someone's going to be around their dipsticks of some kind of general motors.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And I'm a supervisor here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, to the best of my knowledge, I'm not waiting for a package from General Motors.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That says dipsticks.com.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And do you haven't returned any of our voicemails we've left you, sir?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay, I'm not expecting anything from General Motors.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's dipsticks.com, sir.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And I believe I've stated that.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> To the best of my knowledge, I'm not waiting for a package from dipstick.com.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> What address are they supposedly going to be delivering this to?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Do I need to talk to somebody else, or are you the man of the house, or who am I speaking to?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I told you earlier.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> My name is James Leafy.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And as I said, I'm fed a equal with the United Parcel Service.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I've been here for seven months.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, here at UPS.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's fine.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But what I'm trying to determine is, whether or not I'm supposed to be the recipient of this...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> ...the only...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm not expecting anything in the automotive line, which I'm presuming dipstick.com has something to do with.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Either that or it's a pejorative phrase for something else, but I'm not going to worry about that.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, you're the recipient, I can guarantee you that.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I've worked here long enough to determine that for myself.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't need to check with...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I'm just trying to determine whether this was supposed to be a delivery to my business, or to my home.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, I've made the determination, sir.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I haven't.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, no.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Dipstick.com, sir.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> If you can get in gear here and get the payment prepared, we can resolve this this evening and have it to you...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Sir, I honestly think that you should contact my lawyer because I've got nothing to do with anybody named Dickstick.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Dickstick.com.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We've left three voicemails, fella.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, you have not. Not at this number.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And you have not returned any of our messages, and you haven't...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Since I have not gotten them, I haven't returned any.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, I know you haven't returned any. I've left you a voicemail, I left you a slip on the door.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> At this number?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I haven't heard anything from you at all. I know nothing at all.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't know what the obstacle is, but sir, can we resolve this today?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Is my question.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Certainly, if you'll tell me where you anticipated being delivered, what is the delivery address on the parcel?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I don't have it handy, sir. It's on the dock right now.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, well.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, no.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> If you don't have it, then perhaps you should try finding that, so I can determine if this is legitimate.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Sir, I've made the determination, as I said.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But I have not, sir.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, let me just get the number from your account, and then we'll get the payment handled.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> $486, even.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Sir, this is obviously a scam. You'll excuse me if I hang up. Thank you very much.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, no, no, no, no. I don't...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> University of Tennessee.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> This is Juan with UPS.com, so what appears to be the trouble today, sir?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I have no idea. Someone called me and said that I had a package that was supposedly being delivered from dipstick.com,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and that I needed to line up the payment.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I have never ordered anything from any organization named dipstick.com.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I see.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I'm the administrator here. What did you order, and what were you...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I did not order anything.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You did not.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Apparently, you had a disagreement.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And all I was trying to determine was what the delivery address was on this hypothetical parcel,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> so that I could determine whether this had to do with my work or my personal business.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And the individual that was on the phone, who sounds suspiciously like you,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> did not have any idea where it was supposed to be delivered, which seems very odd if you're a United Parcel Service.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm an administrator here. I've been working here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't really care if you're Jesus arisen from the grave.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> If I can't determine that this is a valid delivery for me, I'm not going to accept it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And I don't understand anything about payment for something I have never ordered from an organization named dipstick.com.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I am the embodiment of God. I am divinity and humanity combined.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, so you have a complaint, and I need a payment, and we need the best time to deliver.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Those are the three items on my agenda today, sir. If we can get those resolved today, we'll be in good shape.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I haven't ordered anything, so I am hardly going to pay for something that I haven't ordered.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, okay, you want to come pick it up, you're saying that? I can give you a question.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, I'm saying I did not order any item from any organization named dipstick.com, which is what the first party told me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, I can tell you, I've been here for many, many years. I've seen lots of parcels of all shapes and sizes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's fine, but I have not ordered anything.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, and then you want to come pick it up?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, I want nothing to do with it in any way, shape, or form.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Why don't I come out there myself, get you familiar, right?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Sure. Where are you supposed to be coming?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I am in the administrative office.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And where are you supposed to be coming? Where is the package supposedly to be delivered?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's a residential delivery, sir. I can promise you that.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And to what address?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's a residential address, and I've got a problem bringing that to you, myself.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I want to resolve this here today at UPS.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> How about this?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Why don't you give me your extension? I will call the UPS global number and try to get in contact with you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That sounds phenomenal. I'm at area code.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, no, no. I'm going to call a UPS published number on their website and ask to speak to you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And I need an extension number.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's a problem at all. That's a perfectly suitable suggestion that you've made.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I want to commend you. I want to applaud your willingness to resolve this matter from dipstick.com.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I just need a payment and the best time to deliver.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> A payment for what?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> $486.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Not how much, for what am I supposedly paying?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> For the dipstick.com parcel that you ordered, sir, back here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But I did not order anything from dipstick.com.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I've got your digital signature here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Gee, that's nice. Where did you get that? Who did I order it from?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> From dipstick.com General Motors Group.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Nope. I have never ordered anything from dipstick.com.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Chrysler General Motors Ford or any other group.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's a big, big, colorful bunch of parcels we got here for you, sir.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're going to be delighted when we get there.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I sincerely doubt it. I don't think I ordered this. Thank you very much.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's time to get there today.
    <br>
  </li>
