    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And I didn't order anything from latrina.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's called latrina.com, miss.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't have anything on order.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You keep the sound down and maybe we'll think about coming back out there.

      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> What?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> My dog would have told me if somebody was at the front door.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, your dog was slobbering and barking up a storm.
