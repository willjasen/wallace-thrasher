      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> There was no commotion here, and I don't know what you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And I didn't order anything from Latrina.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You keep the sound down, and maybe we'll think about coming back out there. You feel me?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> What? My dog would have told me if somebody was at the front door.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, your dog was sloth.
      <br>

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You don't know how much of a liar you are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> This dog, this tiny little dog, doesn't slobber.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, ma'am, our driver had slobber on his leg, on his sock.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You can't spell it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Apparently, you can't. You're the one who ordered it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
