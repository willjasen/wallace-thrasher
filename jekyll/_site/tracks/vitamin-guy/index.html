      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It also has what's called a special sustained time-release formula.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Now, that ensures the maximum benefit throughout the day.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you are interested, what we are going to need to finish up the paperwork would be the account number
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> beginning with the four on the visa.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Do you have that information handy?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes, I do, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, well, what we're going to need is the long number that's...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Alright, can you have that there?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, Mike, you have some kind of noise interference.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Again, I can't tell you what it is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, I don't.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You don't know what?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't have it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You don't have what?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't have any interference.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Now you got the number, it begins with the four.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Read that and be slower.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> All right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Betcha.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All right, now read the number because of the form.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You bet.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Not a problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Read the number, Mike.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I can accommodate you there, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, well, Mike, again, if you're not interested, simply say you're not interested.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm very interested, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'd have to be crazy to turn down these wonderful prizes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well again, Mike, again, we do not appreciate the ridicule.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you're not interested, just forget the sarcasm.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All you got to do is simply say I'm not interested.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> not interested. If you are interested, then this is what we're going to need.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> What? Do I have to provide a gridicular butt rod?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If the bill was going on your number, then again, I think you'd be a little more serious with me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I need a gridicular giraffe rod.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Mike, do you have any idea of what's going on here?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Do you have any idea of what we're explaining to you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Um, you mentioned something about a Gary Coleman Nimrod.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Mike, Mike.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Mike, Mike, are you under any kind of medication?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Huh?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Have you taken any medication today?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you're under some form of medication, I can't get back and talk to you yet.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Can?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I can.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I can.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm not going to, you know, I don't want you going to go into a seizure or anything,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> if you need to take any medication right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Um.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What do is I give you a call back,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> something like when you're a little more sedated.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, I'm perfectly fine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, well, good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Then, uh, again, we go over with you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> just round and around. All I'm going to need, if you are interested, if the number
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> that begins with the floor.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Now, reading the number, this is the last time I'm going to ask you, Mike.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you're not interested, tell me you're not interested.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you're interested right now, read me the number to get you with the floor.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Um, it's in, it's in my saxophone. I'm going to have to dig it out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Mike, again, I mean, it could joke all your life, all right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why you want a joke? Again, that's completely up to you. It's not my award.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you don't want it, they'll simply give you to someone else in your area.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, my, it's, the car's in my saxophone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Uh-huh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, Mike, do you have any clue how ridiculous you sound?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I don't think that's very nice.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, again, Mike, I mean, you're two seconds ago, you can hand the car there and now you don't have the car.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I dropped it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, alright, Mike.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, listen, I'm going to be honest with you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you want to have any clue to what you're talking about or anything,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> if you don't have any clue to what you're talking about or
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Any idea of what we're doing here today, I know you would have participated.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I'm trying to be a participant.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, no, no, Mike, you're not trying to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All right, if you're all interested, then simply reading the number beginning with the form.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This is the way we build the account towards the amount of the charge.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I dropped it in my xylophone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, all right. Well, Mike, what I suggest to do is see yourself some medical health.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What's the problem?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, well, again, I don't have free to start this, but you're not in this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't think that's right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't think that's right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> friendly.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Mike, you're, I'm telling you, Mike, you're hysterical.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know, I love to sit here and waste my valuable time on you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But unfortunately, I have a board meeting to go to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I do want you know that you are turning the war down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, I'm not.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, Mike, again, unless you're going to cooperate with me
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and give you the information I need in order to fill out the paperwork,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I am going to have to let you go.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> How about if I perform a taekwondo on you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, again, Mike, if that's what you'd like to do,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> feel free, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
