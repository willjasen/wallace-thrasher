  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Thank you for calling Shoots Mark Fort Worth. This is Benjamin. How can I help you today?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hi, yeah, my name's Weber. I just moved here to Fort Worth and was looking for a new gun,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> new weapon. And I read about you, so I thought I'd give you a holler. How you doing up there?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Ah, well, we're doing okay. We do have a fair amount of different finds that are available
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> for sale and available for rent if you want to try one out before you buy them.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, really? Good, good, good. Yeah, the last gun shop in town I went to, they loaded me up
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> with a bunch of squib, so that's why I'm phoning you. As far as I know, most of the ammunition
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> that we get is the manufacturer of fresh. We do actually contract through a loading company,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> but we've had almost no squibs from them whatsoever. I think Benjamin has with him for three years
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> now, and I think we've had maybe one or two. Sensational. Good to hear. Well, I can say
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> with my previous weapon, I felt limited by the bolt action, so I'm looking for something
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> with a real good boar on it. A lot of kick. I was thinking of something with a rechargeable
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> mainspring. What do you think? I honestly don't know much about that kind of stuff. That would
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> be a question for my gunsmiths. Well, I was thinking maybe dry firing a few guns, make a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> decision on what to buy. Can I set an appointment with you? We don't do appointments. Everything's
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> just first come first served. You can stop into the retail area at any time. Though,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> if it's your time, though, we do have to limit the amount of people that are in the store.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, yeah, of course, of course. Well, in a partition bullets, blanks, it doesn't matter
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> to me. I'm firing my weapon every day and night, so I need something that's going to do the job,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and I don't want too much choke on there. I mean, I'm 77 years old. I don't need to be loading up
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> on bird shot here. You know what I mean? Okay, well, specifically, I experienced some hang fire.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> The last time I had a shootout. What do you recommend to avoid that?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Honestly, hang fires usually those typically only happen with the older styled firearms.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> They usually don't happen with firearms. Okay. But usually, yeah, a lot of them,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> especially with the old black powder firearms, which is where indoor only range, we actually
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> don't allow black black powder rifles. Well, good, good, good, good. I just don't know what to buy.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I mean, my uncle would always say a real marksman doesn't use a floating barrel.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What kind of propellant you all use up there? I honestly don't know. So we just border the stuff
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> from manufacturers. I'm interested in double action caulking on my new weapon.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What kind of lever action you got up? I don't have any lever actions right now.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, okay. Well, I read about a hack where you can tweak the magnification on your scope.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Up to like a hundred thousand X. Did you read about that one?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I honestly have not read that, sir. That's okay. That's okay. I was having a problem fitting
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> both a dampener and crosshairs on my last weapon. Some of these newer weapons accommodate both or
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> again, I don't know. That's going to be a question for a done Smith. Well, I usually remove the
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> hammer block from my weapon. My sergeant used to say those were for intermediates. You know what I
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> mean? No, sir, I don't. I don't. I don't understand what you're what you mean. I'm not a done Smith.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's okay. Hey, that's fine. I'm new here. So I'm just trying to get a feel. I have another weapon
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> where I wanted to customize my muzzle. Can you all help me do something like that or? Yes, my guns
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> can take care of that. Excellent. And I also inadvertently jammed my sling swivel. I was hoping
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you could all help me dislodge it. Possibly. Yeah. You want me to bring my snub nose up or? Or what?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, you know, I usually only wear body armor when I fire boat tail bullets. But do you got any armor
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> upper? We don't sell armor right now. Okay. Yeah. Well, whatever I get, I really want to ramp up
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> my ejector and my extractor. So that's what I'm kind of looking for. You can narrow it down with
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> that kind of parameter. Again, that's going to be a gunsmith thing. A gunsmith. I got you over to
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> the gunsmith. Sounds like you got more questions for them. And then oh, no, it's okay. No, Benjamin,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you've been helpful. My granddad always said that a Magnum projectile cut down on misfires,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you know, duds. So something with a Magnum projectile is what I'm looking to incorporate.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I can handle recoil. Not a problem. Not a problem. I always wear a backstrap. So
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> that's no problem at all. Do you got any kind of fouling retardant up there?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't believe we do now. Or for rent? Well, maybe for rent. Just something with a whole lot of
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> kick. A whole lot of kick. I can handle the kick back. Something with a rechargeable
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> mainspring. Is that something you offer? I honestly don't know. So there are years talking stuff that
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have no idea what what it even means. I just don't want too much choke on there. Whatever I buy.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Again, I honestly don't know what you're talking about. So I'm I'm no modern firearms. But the
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> stuff you're talking about, I have not seen or used and to be honest, not many people have quite
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> recently. So oh, I see what kind of lever action you got up there. I don't have any lever actions
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> right now. I usually remove the hammer block from my whip. And like I say, so I don't need anything
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> like that. And so where do you stand on the slink swivel? You with me there, Benjamin?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Thank you for calling Two Smart Fort Worth. This is Benjamin. How can I help you today?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes. Do you guys sell buckshot upper? We do have buckshot available. Yes. But we're only selling it
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> for range use right now. Oh, why is that? We're just really, really short on ammunition. We want
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> to make sure we have enough for anybody that wants to come in to use the range. Yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah. Just factory fresh ammo. Yes, it is factory fresh ammo.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So I don't want to end up with a stove pipe on my hands. You know what I'm saying?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I completely understand. Yeah. Shotguns usually don't still pipe.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You need some squib up there, are you?
    <br>
  </li>
