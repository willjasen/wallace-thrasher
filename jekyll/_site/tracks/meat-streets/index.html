    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> You ain't going to get that deputy on me, are you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Oh, don't do that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm just sitting here letting you sit on the phone and hang yourself. I'm recording every bit of it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Oh, stop recording me. Don't do it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Too late.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> The best thing you can do is hang up and don't call back.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Steven speaking?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Oh, we're here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Can I get a few ounces of tendon for tonight?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know that I actually have any in stock at the moment. I'll be right back.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I do need a few ounces of urine, too, and blood.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> The tendon we could do, but the rest, unfortunately, we couldn't do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Just not something that we carry.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Full disclosure, I'd probably accept some of your own urine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, some of my own.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, no, unfortunately, I don't give away my own urine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's my own policy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It'd be like a conflict.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> of interest, really working in a place that, you know, sells that kind of stuff.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, I would just wouldn't feel right, given that away.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I'd insist on paying you something for your time and for your, of course, your urine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, no, no, I definitely understand that, yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But unfortunately, it's just not something that I would be willing to do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'd have to check with my wife, too, and, yeah, you know, that doesn't always go so well.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Maybe after hours, I can meet you outside in the back and just pick it up?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, but that's always kind of sketchy giving my urine away to somebody after hours.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It just doesn't seem right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I'm a good Christian, I assure you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, no, no, I fully understand it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you know, good Christian and all, but I'm atheist, so that really doesn't matter much to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> The flavor profile of the urination in the tendon is just something I prefer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But, you know, I mean, you don't know what my diet's like, so it might not be something that you would
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> enjoy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I know, but you're in the business, so I assume it would be preferable to my own.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, but I'm vegetarian, though.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> So let me just get some blood and urine, like I say, any source you can get it from, and the tendon,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> and I can be there for tonight, so I'm good?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, I'll tell you what, we'll meet you after, and we'll see what we can figure out for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Okay, yeah, okay, yeah, okay, yeah, okay, yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Okay, yeah, okay, yeah, okay, yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Um, um, can I please pick up a few ounces of urine and blood for tonight?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> No, something else, we don't carry it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Not much, you know, a gallon, it could be mixed, you understand?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Yeah, but we don't carry anything like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> How you doing today?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> I'm doing good, are you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Excellent, superb, yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> You know, full disclosure, you could even supply your own urine and blood, and how much would that cost mean?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Good morning, Millington's.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Yeah, guy, listen, I just need some urination for this evening, that's it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Are you taking the piss?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> No, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I can give you three, four dollars.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> I don't care what you're doing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> You're taking the piss.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> That's a crude way of putting it, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Just don't, we can't do it, we're not doing it, and don't call me again.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Which part are you refusing?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> I'm refusing everything because I've never had a phone call like this in my life.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Listen, maybe after hours we go off premises, you just give me what to need you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Just, you know, forget it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Go somewhere else.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> play your games, but don't play any more on me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> We can work something out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I'm sure of it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I'm confident, but we can work it out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Fuck that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> I'm out. I'm out of here.
      <br>
