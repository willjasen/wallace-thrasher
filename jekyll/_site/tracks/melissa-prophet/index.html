  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I've heard of you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Of course I've heard of you, but I've never heard of Arikos on that.

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I'm calling you right now.
    <br>
  </li>

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yes.

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I mean, you're calling me from a block number and you just gave me a number to check it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That is not true.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That is not true.
    <br>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I don't understand why you don't have a number, honey.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I just gave it to you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I just dialed it from another number.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm sitting here with two assistants.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We did dial.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Zero, zero, zero.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> One, two, four, five, six, seven.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We dialed it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We dialed it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Let me just try it one more time.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Where everybody sees at play five.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Let me have your email address and I'll shoot you a payment right now.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah, remember as it worked.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Why would I give you my email?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I've got six email addresses.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'd be happy to give you one, but there's no payment because you don't have a number.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It basically means you don't exist with your iPhone.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> All I need.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'll have you back from a real number.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Let me figure out what's your real and we'll talk.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> There's not enough money for me to sit here and let you entertain yourself.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You need to be able to use a lighter.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's the only stipulation.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I think you better go back to doing the drugs and you just send a stop before you called
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> me.
    <br>
  </li>
