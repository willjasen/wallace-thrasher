      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm not familiar with what your laser oil is.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You're frightening.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> What are you looking for, dude?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I need to get a fence set up to keep this opossum out of my affairs.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> How about I come in there and knock your head a little bit?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Am I really getting a phone call for someone asking about laser oil and it's threatening
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> to beat me up?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> This is a business.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You're threatening me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I mean, there's two ways of doing things, but I'll basically just call the cops right
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So if you want to do that, go ahead and come on down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay, bro, but I have to go.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm trying to help a customer and I have a certain reputation.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So I don't know what laser oil is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I don't know what your problem is, but no one's disrespecting me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm going to need store credit, I figure, because while we're talking here, this opossum
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> has just wiped me out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I don't understand what an opossum is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I don't have store credit.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well you can just let me take what I need.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm going to report you for calling and threatening me multiple times, so I'm going
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> to get up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Honestly, goodbye.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Good Avenue sign.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Trick speaking.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I need to get some magnetic oil.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Magnetic oil?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> We don't have anything like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I'm shooting lasers and I got a cordone it off with magnetic oil.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I think you might have phoned the wrong number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> We're a sign shop.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, you have magnets, don't you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Yeah, well, how much do you need?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I've got 4,200 lasers firing right here, fella.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Well, I don't know anything about your company.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> You could tell you the truth, so, you know, I've got a little bit of magnetic material
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> If you need more, I can order some in, but-
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> How about if I start firing lasers up there?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I don't know what you're looking for, you know?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I sell magnetic sheeting, yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> If you'd like some of that, I can sell me that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> But I don't sell magnetic oil.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> You know, if you explain what you'd like, it'd be a lot easier for me to decide if I
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> happen to not.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I want to drape giant sheets of magnet over my lasers.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Well, then you'd probably be better off to phone a magnetic wholesaler.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> A sailor.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't have time to-
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Whole sailor.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm not talking about oysters here, fella, I'm talking about lasers.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You with me?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I understand what you need, but you know the difference between wholesale and retail?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Are you a marine biologist, or what are you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What is your problem, man?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Look, I'm firing lasers up here, and I don't have time to go down to the dock, or whatever
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> it is you're suggesting, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Do you know what a wholesaler is?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> It's a company that sells to retail shops.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I buy magnetic from a magnetic whole sailor.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Why don't you write-
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Nothing to do with ships, or fish, or oceans.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> What part don't you-
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> If there's some kind of joke phone call, man, or what?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Why don't you run up here and give me what I need?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't know what you need.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm firing lasers every which way up here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't really care.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Your science has magnetic, fella.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> It says magnetic, yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> It's a sheeting of magnetic, it's got nothing to do with oil.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're running me around here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I think you should call somebody else, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I do.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I need it polished up, but I need all the wheels inflated, and then deflated and inflated
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> all over again.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
