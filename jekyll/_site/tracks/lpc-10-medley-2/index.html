        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I need to get a fence set up to keep this opossum out of my affairs.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> A fence. I don't set up fences, dude. I'm an indoor hydroponist store. I'm like, I'm a grow shop. I got<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> so growing equipment. Ballets, bulbs, lights.<br>

      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So if you want to do that, go ahead and come off down. Okay, bro, but I have to go. I'm trying to help a customer, and I have a certain reputation.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>

        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, I'm shooting lasers, and I got to cordone it off with magnetic oil.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I think you might have phoned the wrong number. We're a sign shop.<br>

      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Well, I don't know anything about your company to tell you the truth, so, you know, I've got a little bit of magnetic material here.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> If you need more, I can order some in, but...<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> How about if I started firing lasers up there?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I don't know what you're looking for, you know?<br>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> But I don't sell magnetic oil.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> You know, if you explain what you'd like, it'd be a lot easier for me to decide if I have it or not.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I want to drape giant sheets of magnet over my lasers.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Well, then you'd probably be better off to phone a magnetic wholesaler.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> A sailor? I don't have time to...<br>
