      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> of bakeware here in my foundry, and I'm thinking of getting into an alloy of some kind instead.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Do you guys maybe have any pig iron available that I could purchase?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I really don't have anything like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Everything we carry is pretty much structural, so all the shapes, and the sheets, and the
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> plates, and angles, and channels, and flat bar, and that kind of stuff.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, yeah, that's what I mean.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'd like to guild the fulcrum, so maybe could I add some nickel to it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm going along those lines, because, yeah, I guess I'm good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm tempering my scrap.

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm tempering my scrap currently, and I typically galvanize my pipe and my furnace, but I'm
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> ending up with molten leakage every damn wire.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So do you think I should puddle my scrap, or I'm kind of at a loss or so?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah, and when I say I'm not familiar with most of the terms you're using.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So could I use a stiffener or would it be too bulbous?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Obviously I don't want any buckling.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> How are you doing?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Pretty good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hey, good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hey, I think I've hit upon a solution with all the crockery.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I think I'm forging here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Like when I make a peripheral or a pudding or something, the bottom will always burn, you
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> know?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So, but I think if I had scalp to my bakeware, it would be perfect.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Then I could make jelly or meringue.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So maybe if I butt weld the scalp, what do you think on something like that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I have no idea what you're talking about, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I'm ready to get cast in with you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm ready to pour here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't know what you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't have anything going with you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm a cook.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I'm trying to get the right kind of crockery for all my food.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'd like to put down a deposit, maybe on some electrolytic tin plating or something.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I think that would brighten my tubing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, hey.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That reminds me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Do you guys ever go exotic, like fabricates or conium or something, or do a half-neum
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> extrusion or anything like that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Because I got to have 48 canalay cooked by this weekend.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And this alcapulco pot metal is just not cutting it, friend.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
