        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I understand that you're shooting Little Miss Clackamas.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know, we're a photography store, and you want to do it on film.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I understand that you want it to look pixelated.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And my idea was to convert it to film.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Is that sound like in the ballpark of what you want to do?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, and I was hoping maybe you could, maybe look into my mouth.<br>
      </li>

        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I feel like I have something stuck in my teeth.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm sorry. I don't understand what you're wanting us to do. You know, this is an odd. You're just, like, I don't understand the conversation. Just, like, I understand that you're shooting this, little Miss Clack Miss, and the first thing he said that you're shooting it on film and you want it to look pixelated, and that was my solution. You know, does that sound right that you want it, that digitizing it to make it look pixelated? And that was my solution. You know, does that digitizing it to make it look pixelated?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> pixel life would work for you.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But I've got the sensation as if there's something stuck in my teeth, and would you consider looking in my mouth,<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> maybe with a high-resolution photography machine?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't do that. You might want to go to a dentist to accomplish that that that has the equipment<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> for inner oral photography.<br>

      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have Portra 100. I have Portra 400, 160, 800. That would be great to shoot in this. Little Miss<br>

        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> just a scosh.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, if you want to accomplish a pixelated image, you're going to have to get your film<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> scanned to digital.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm live at an event.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know, I got stuff to pixelate up there.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, to make it a pixelated look, you're going to have to do that in post-processing.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Just shoot your event, and when you get done, get it scanned to digital.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Because pixelation is not a term that you use for film.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You use the term greeniness for film in that.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you wanted a grainy look, you would use a high-speed film.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you want to pixelate it as a similar thing, but it's mainly when you consider something<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>None:</strong> low resolution.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It makes it kind of cubular because a pixel is square, not circular, where grain is kind of circular,<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> but not really.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's just the texture of silver particles in the film.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, now as I said, I've got this strong sensation in my gum line.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> that I've got something stuck in my teeth.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Now, where do you stand on that?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm sorry.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not going this direction again, sir.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you want to talk to one of my other sales associates, I'm glad to pass you on to them.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But I'm not a dentist.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have nothing to do with that.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just take a look.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Tell me what you see.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's not my business, and you're not in front of me.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I couldn't do that anyways.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But I'm sorry.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just speculate then.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not going to speculate on the health of your gum.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm sorry, sir.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not.<br>
      </li>

        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I said, I don't think you recognize what's the stay for these little gals out here.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm sorry, sir.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We could further this discussion if you want to come in.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We can figure out how to pixelate your film, but I'm not a board-certified dentist.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm sorry.<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> How about I pixelate your teeth a couple times here?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Left, middle left.<br>
