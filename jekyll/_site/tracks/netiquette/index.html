      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> All right, let me, let me do this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Let me get a phone number where I can get back to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Sure.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And then you want to hit the protocol nine on your universal resource locator on your
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> URL.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's my phone number.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, my Usenet group, my user ID.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's where we get into the problem because I don't have you bookmarked yet.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't have you pinned to my menu at my startup.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So I'm subject to spam and everything else.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And that's where the whole netiquette thing comes in.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So what should I do with that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> With the netiquette angle on it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I would try and try.
      <br>
    </li>
