    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You're not going to be a tenant anywhere. You're calling him for money?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, no, I need an apartment.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't care what you need. Do not call him anymore. You don't call someone for money. You need an apartment.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You don't call someone. I don't want to do business with him.

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's for some suits, robes, things like that, for a couple months.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know who you are and I don't know where you live. Where do you live?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I live two houses down. My gardener gave me the number. He said that'd be okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I can give you three, four dollars a month. I have robes, suits, some shift on, mainly the shift on that needs protecting.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I could bring them over.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, I don't have any room for that, sir. I'm sorry.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just for a couple months. I have a small place.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, no, no, I understand that. I don't have any room for that, so.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I can bring by just a couple of the items.
    <br>
  </li>

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Not okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's not okay. No. It's not okay at all. I'm sure you'll find some other neighbors who may be able to accommodate you, but I can't.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know anybody else in the area. I'm new here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What street do you live on?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We'll get it done. I'm real new. I don't know what you want from me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> He said you'd help me, so I can walk down there.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Sir, sir, don't walk down. Don't call anymore. Have a great day.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm just going to pop by. It'll be no problem. I'm just out of space.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Sir, sir, if you drop by, you'd be met by a police officer.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So don't believe.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> It's rough. It's challenging.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> We've had problems with water dripping in on my apartment.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I told the landlady about it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> And she took pictures of it and didn't correct the situation.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> It's a challenge living here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> And then someone's smoking a lot, and it comes into my apartment a lot.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Do you have that same problem?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've smelled something, yeah.

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Well, there's people who smoke a lot, do a lot of smoking.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> There's one guy smoking pot that lives by me, another guy,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> a lady up above me smoking heavily, and it comes all in my apartment.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> How did you get my number?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> For my gardener.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Oh, you're a good gardener.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I got a job interview on Monday.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Is there any way you could lend me like a hat and a belt?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Well, I don't know if my clothes fit you, but I can give you some of my clothes I don't wear,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> but I don't know if they fit you, but I'll have to hand them outside the door.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Just let me find what size do you wear?
    <br>
  </li>
