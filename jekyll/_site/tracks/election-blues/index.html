      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello. Hello. Who's this?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm Dawson and I'm trying to gather some information about the election.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, you call here twice in the last minute phone. You better stop.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, I don't... And who I vote for, or my wife, is none of your damn business.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah. Hello.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'll stop calling. Do you want to go vote together?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No. I'll stop calling. Yes, I was just calling to ask who you voted for.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Um, I don't really think that's any of your business.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I'll give you $450. Yeah, I bet you will.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm sure you will. And when we tell you one other thing, you call back here
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and you'll be paying somebody else $450 like a lawyer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You should vote for me. Yeah, uh-huh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Have a nice evening. You should vote for me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I need you to tell me who you voted for, if you, or if you even voted.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Excuse me? Who'd you vote for, pal?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Who'd I vote for, pal? I voted for Mao Zedong.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Who? Mao Zedong.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We've been, what, it's been a bit... Actually, it's been a friend of mine,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and we've known each other since we're in politics together.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm an registered independent.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I am a Marxist, socialist, Leninist, communist Christian.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Let's see, what up? American, socialist, workers, party, union member, Republican.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm an Ethiopian, yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Come election day, how's that sound? You need another drink.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You need to get back into that stew you've been in.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't usually give you people this much time, but this is rather enjoyable.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Now, what, who, who, who would you get this number?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm a opinion, yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Go back to the stew.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes, who I was just voting for, who you voted for.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I think they asked you not to call here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I think they asked you not to call here twice, and then I won't have to get.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I was calling to find out who you were voting for.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> None, if you're business, don't call again, you call this eight times, we're sick of it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, I didn't even call you before.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, yes, you have. Don't call again.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Who are you voting for?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, that's not the nature of a call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, what the hell is the nature of the call?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's none of your business.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'll give you $450 for the information.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Who should I vote for?
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I do not care.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This is Dick, calling, and I was just calling to ask who you
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> are voting for.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, that's private.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And you just called this number, I think.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Do you have a phone number?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Could you tell it to me?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I'm just, so I'm the one calling you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, I'm asking you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you want to ask me a personal question,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I think I should be able to ask you one.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I think that thing you just said was obnoxious.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But since I got caller ID, all right,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I might not need you to answer the question for me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I think that was kind of an obnoxious reason.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What you just said.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't think you need to be calling this number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And if you call this number again,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> yeah, I'm going to press charges again.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you understand, well, I'll give you $450 for the information.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You'll pay me to tell you who I will vote for.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's illegal.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why are you calling here?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Do you need a doctor?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I just want to know where you're going.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, I'm asking you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Are you seeing a psychiatrist because you really
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> should be calling them and not me?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What is your failure tonight?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sir, you've called me three times.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I've asked you not to call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What is your deal?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I've asked you not to respect an individual.
      <br>
    </li>
