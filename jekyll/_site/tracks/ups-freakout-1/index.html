      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I think he just spoke to my boy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> She missed me.
      <br>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I think he just spoke to my son on the phone if he wanted to come in.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, if he's talking about a CFO back at COD, it doesn't belong to us.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I think...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And he wasn't rude to your son because I was laying on the couch listening to him.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> He just said, bring it on by and he would look at it.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I think you guys need to re-evaluate where we're going.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I think that I will call the police if you continue to ask, maybe because I understand why you're bothering me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know.
      <br>
