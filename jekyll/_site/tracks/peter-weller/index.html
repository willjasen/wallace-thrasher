      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But, you know, I have a post office...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> box where I get all mail. I did not get mail at my house.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, well, UPS will not deliver to a post office box.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I don't know what to do, but...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> This is from banana boat.com. Does that ring a bell?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Banana, no, no. No, it does not ring a bell.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, how late is somebody going to be there tonight? We'll dispatch another driver.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No one's going to be there tonight. I get nothing. Nothing at my place of a dress. Nothing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But, sir, we've been there three times already.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> from UPS and no one answered the bell.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't even, I don't know what you're talking about because there's nothing that ever even says where my address is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> There's no record of my address anywhere.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, we left you a slip on the door, and no one replied from banana boat.com, Mr. Weller, correct?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Or Wheeler?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, Mr. Wheeler, if you're going to be there in the next 45 minutes...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It's weller and no one's...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> there, and no one receives anything there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Peter Webb.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah, so if you're not telling me the address that they're sending it to, I can't help you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, we can't just simply send it back, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's from banana boat.com.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So, like, as I say, I'll make sure to have an express driver out there in the next 45 minutes for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's not a problem at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Not a problem at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Listen, you're not hearing me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't get anything, and if you're not telling me,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> address, I don't want it or care about it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, okay.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> If you're not giving me an address where you're delivering it, I cannot be responsible for it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> My name's Hucker.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'll have somebody out there in the next 30 to 45.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Not a problem.
      <br>
