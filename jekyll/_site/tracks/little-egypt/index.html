      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> some inappropriate materials.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What would that be?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Our driver and our collection agent has been picking up some things, some hemoglobin plasma,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> things that are not suitable for disposal in your receptacle bin there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, I mean, we would have no reason to be disposing of blood.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We don't even have blood, per se.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, it's been ongoing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> He brought it to my attention.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm a manager here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I just told him just to keep an eye on it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And there's been some.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know, hooves and stuff as well in there, and fur and plasma, and hemoglobin, like I say.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hooves, I mean, we don't see any large animals.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> There wouldn't be hooves.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, it would behoove you to cut it out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And there's not going to be, now there might be a test tube with some blood, but this is all animal blood.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> There's no human hazardous waste with that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Not human, no, it's been anatomical animal stuff.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Like there was a rump.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and maybe some tails in there as well.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So we did have to impose a fine, a small one just for your first infraction.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I need to know some more specifics here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So I know, because so far, if I understand you, I don't.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I guess I need to know specifically what we're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's a $398 fine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We can just send a rep out and pick a checkup for that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, but what I was saying, I need to know specifically what is not appropriate.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I can't not do something if I don't know what that something is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sure thing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Obviously, tails and rumps and hooves.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Tails and rumps.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I, this, we only deal with small animals, and I'm not cutting tails off of animals.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, maybe not you, maybe someone else on staff or a colleague.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But, but I'm not accusing you, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm not accusing you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, but all I'm saying is I can't stop doing something that I don't know I'm doing in the first place.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And there was some crustacean-related stuff in there, too.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Frustation.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Now, what, okay, can you explain what crustacean stuff is?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, like a crab, a peri-o-od, like a claw, like a claw,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you know, a claw or abdominal segment of a crustace.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We don't even deal with.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> any type of that critter.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Dogs and cats, we're not cutting tails off.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's not something we do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This just doesn't make any sense to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I guess you don't know anything about all the bumblebees either, is what you're going to tell us.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Because we found a lot of bumblebees in the bin.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> The antennas, the wings, these things are not meant for a public bin.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, there's no way we're putting bumblebees in there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't even have access to bumblebees.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So it shouldn't be a problem to curtail this sort of activity, is what you're saying.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You'll have no problem discontinuing these practices is what I'm here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I can't discontinue something that I'm not doing in the first place.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sir, there were gizzards in there, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> There were livers, there was fur.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This just isn't correct, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Huffs, okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> There's not a hoofs.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I never seen a horse at our practice here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I didn't say it was a horse, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It could have been from, you know, a donkey.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I mean...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> A monkey.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know what kind of animal is you treated.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, I don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This is crazy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If there's a problem, somebody show me specifically what we're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I'm at Midwest Waste.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm Vernon.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Ernest is our driver.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You've probably seen about your establishment dozens of times, I guess.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So it's just like I say, it's a $389 fee.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, I'm not paying for any fee unless somebody can present this stuff to me and show me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, we'll send a rep out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I want to see the stuff you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We have photographs.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Not a problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Not a problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you don't pay, there will be an interruption in your service.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I do want you to be aware of that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not going to pay for anything here unless somebody can present me proof of this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Because the stuff you're naming, we just don't have here at our practice.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, we have the proof, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Right here on our digital camera, that we have all of the material that we have all of the material that we
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> picked up and collected at your site.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I personally took the photos.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'll show you the photos.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We'll send a rep out, pick a check up, and we'll drop on.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Now, I'm not paying anybody a check here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This is a bunch of horse hockey.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, then we're going to discontinue your service.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I guess you'll have to do that, and we'll have to get somebody else that's going to be truthful
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and honest about things then.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Because we don't even have the stuff here that you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I mean, to stop with the beaks and the livers and the gizzards and the bumblebees,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> all that stuff, to stop it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And there'll be no issue.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I mean, you're saying that...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> There's never been beaks here anyway.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We have no birds on the premises.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And as far as the bumblebees, no, that just doesn't make any sense.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I didn't even know there were crustations in this part of town.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But, you know, that's none of my concern.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know, this is ridiculous.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you can discontinue...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I've got other things to do with my time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, we'll send a rep out.
      <br>
    </li>
