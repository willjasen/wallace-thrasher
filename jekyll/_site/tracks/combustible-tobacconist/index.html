    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I was talking to you and beer on Butler kicked in.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I mean, honestly, honey, I mean, I don't know what to tell you. I've never heard of that in my entire life.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I've been in this business since 2009. I've never heard of a cigar blowing up on you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> You should have actually brought it in to show me. Do you remember what kind of cigar it was?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Cigars don't blow up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Honey, I could never give you a refund if we don't even know what kind it is and I didn't see the cigar.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> That's not really anything.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Hello?

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Whoever this guy is calling me, his phone is doing something.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> So it's calling me and then I'm talking to him and then now you just kicked in and started talking.
    <br>
