      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Be fire stuff up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Burn it up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Just fire it up everywhere.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Just fire it up everywhere.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> There you. Big poop panties and stuff.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> A big poop man is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I didn't even had to get you up if you wanted to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> I don't go to fire.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I don't get that bird going.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I don't believe society exists.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> There's no such thing as society.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> The idea of society is something that was used by parents and teachers
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> and clergymen and other authority figures in order to control children as children as children are used.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> As children are growing up, in order to believe that there's something called society,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> so that when they do grow up, they become complacent as sheep,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> and behave in these proscribed manners and build some sort of imaginary power structure
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> that only benefits people in positions of power.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> But power itself is an illusion.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> The only thing that power means is that people agree that somebody should be in power.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And that's how people like Jim Jones rise to power.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> He gets a lot of people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> people to agree that he should be in charge and that they should listen to him.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And if you don't like people like Jim Jones or Hitler or anybody in power, you don't even fight with them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> You just walk away from them and say, I don't need you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I don't need your leadership.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I don't need you to tell me what to do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Hello.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Is this a wrong number?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> No.

    </li>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> been several calls made to this number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm trying to get through.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I haven't got through it yet.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Okay, but the party that we're calling keeps refusing the charges.
