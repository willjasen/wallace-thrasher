      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> by one of my managers actually after them.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm sorry about it, but it's very strange.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm listening to the really strange noises.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I know somebody was asking me some questions.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Is this a real call?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Or are you because right now I don't exactly know what's going on.

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's actually very strange questions the one that you're asking me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> At the meantime, I'm listening like very strange noises at the phone
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and this is actually not normal and I'm sorry about it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I think there is a small misunderstanding within this call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And stuff which look like orange mothballs.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sir, if I keep listening to this song, I'm going to hang off the call
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> because I'm listening very strange noises.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know if this is a real call or if it's not.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But is that kind of a joke or anything, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Because I don't understand, like, massage the lizards.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know anybody who would massage the lizards.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sorry, but I'm still listening on these stage noises.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And it's actually not normal.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All the noises that I'm actually listening to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I mean, I don't understand.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We know which thing says to have the question that you have to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If it's about the lizards, definitely you will send me the email.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I will definitely write it down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I will make sure that we send it to our concierge.

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But I don't know which kind of massage to can we do to a lizards, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know which kind of massage can we do to a lizards,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> or something like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But I don't really understand the purpose of this call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Here, let me give you my leader.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> with mandyan alphabetical structures.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So as I told you once again, I would need to really hang off the phone
