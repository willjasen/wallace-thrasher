    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Sure.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No worries. No worries.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I said, what's the meaning of life?

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm just kidding.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You know?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> It's not a universal answer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm pretty convinced.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> It varies from individual to individual, up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'll tell you, let me get some accompaniment with that.
      <br>

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I'm going to take your call to moment.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> The face of your name, number, and a brief message.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm going to marinate on that a little bit.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm going to marinate.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And then, frankly, I'm going to urinate a little later in the hour.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Thanks for asking, though.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'll get back to you up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have a question that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I was wondering.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> wondering about the Gomez call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> She says you've been calling all the time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Can you tell a little bit about the, like, the stuff we didn't hear before that,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> the one call that is on the album?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> The Gomez, you know, there's a misconception that I spent, like, a year or a long time
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> calling a wrong number and, you know, setting it up for the time where I finally called as myself.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And that's not true.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> It was spontaneous.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> It was improvised.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I looked in the phone book under Gomez, and that's what happened.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So it was just spur of the moment of blah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And that's really all there was to it, you know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And that lady and I are now married.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So there you go.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> No, I appreciate it.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Oh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> Hey, uh, what's, what's pipe in LBC?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> I was just.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> Oh, this and that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> I was just wondering how you originally got into contact with Mr. Trebek, how you originally got that number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Yeah, I've kind of stopped.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I've been tempted to wish him well lately with his recent prognosis.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> But it was just another one of those things that was given to me by a person.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And I called it, you know, a little unsure of its validity.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> But as soon as he answered, and I mean, instantaneously, I knew it was him.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And, you know, that was, God, 10 years ago already.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So, and he's kept his phone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> He's kept it on.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> He answers it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You know, fricking, let's call him right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Here we go.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Some questions about your account here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> We've been noticing some excessive usage to 900 numbers, 976 numbers,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> for that particular exchange.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So we have instituted a block.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You'll have to pay extra for those types of calls going forward.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> Wait, what, hold on a second.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> Yes, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> What phone number are you referring to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> All phone numbers associated with your account.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> I haven't been making any outgoing calls to a 976 number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I hear that all the time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So we have restricted those types of exchanges, 900, 976 numbers.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> are going to be blocked.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> What is a 976 number?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Oh, entertainment line, psychics, a lot of late night phone numbers, things of that nature.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I don't know if you have someone else in the house who's making the calls.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> No, it's just my phone and my wife's phone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay, maybe she's making the 900 number calls.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Maybe I need to talk to her.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> I don't think that she would be the one making those calls.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay, so it is you making those calls.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> All right, well, there is a block on there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> If you want to reverse that, it is a one-time charge of $129.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> We can just do that by credit card, Master Charge, or Visa, if you'd like to reverse that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> No, thanks.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> I'm okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay, well, then we're going to leave the block on there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And if you do a...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> attempt any more of those calls. We will block local calls as well.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So I'd advise you to discontinue that at once, pretty much.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay, goodbye.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> He's gone on, on, on, on, on, on, on.
      <br>
