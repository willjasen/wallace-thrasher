  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello. Mr. Piven. Yeah, I was this. This is Rocky from the Jeopardy TV office. How are you doing?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not giving Jeopardy TV office. You've got to come up with something that is mad.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's the truth. Mr. Trebek is launching a new spin-off program for the network called What's Kraken.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> He wanted me to get you on the line and patch you through to him. And if you're able to talk about it briefly here for a moment today.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Debbie, thank you. Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hello. Hi. Hello. Hello. Who's this yet? Who's it? I don't know. I was just patched through to you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm sorry. I was just patched through to you. I think what is where are you located?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I am inside of your subconscious. And I've been with you since you've been conscious just shortly after you exited the womb.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Shortly after what? As soon as you got out of the womb and you were conscious, I've been with you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, sorry. I actually ate your inception inside the womb.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm having trouble understanding what you're saying.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Who were you kind of? That's the problem. Go inward. What I suggest is a quick 10 or 20 minutes in the morning meditation.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And you and I will be together and we'll be together forever, really. I just want to check in and say hello.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. Thank you. Okay. God bless her. And carry on. Take the high road. Class is always half full.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Mr. Trebek, I've got Mr. Piven on the line.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Who? Mr. Piven. Piven? Yes. Which Piven? Jeremy Piven. Let me see if I can get him back on the line.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay. Why was Jeremy calling me? About a new program from Viacom called Let's Crack In.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm trying to get him on the line for you again right now. I apologize.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, who are you trying to get? You're trying to get Jeremy Piven on the line for who?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> For you, sir. And my name is Alex Trebek. Yes. Okay. Hello. Hello. Is this Jeremy? Who is this? This is Alex Trebek.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm not quite sure I believe it, sir. Well, I am. The answer is Alex Trebek.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I just didn't inform that you were trying to call me. Oh, no, that's funny.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I mean, it's so interesting. Well, we're sorry to bother you. Someone called me and asked me through to you somehow.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So someone's playing a prank on both of us. I think so, sir. No, it's regarding the program. What's cracking?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We were meant to work it out here. Jeremy, do you know anything about this? I really don't. Not a thing.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And I don't either. What has happened in recent months, and I don't know if you've experienced this, my phone will ring.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And it will be somebody in some other part of the country who's phone rang at the same time.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Somebody has managed to come up with a system where they can call two people, and each person thinks that he's been called by the other person, and neither one knows anything about it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So if Viacom is doing a show, Jeremy, and they want you to do it, to listen to their proposal, and if they want me to get involved, I'll listen to their proposal.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But at the moment, I have no knowledge of what the hell this is all about. But I'm an advisor of your work.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And you as well, sir, and listen, I think you're way too busy to take on another show, and I think it's your personal advisor now, and that's the way I think to myself.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So I would advise you to take a little time off because you work very hard.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, yeah, but we only do two days a week, so I do have a lot. A lot of people think I've got it too easy.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> They say maybe you should work harder.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Wow. That's why we call from What's Cracking, sir?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay, well, hopefully somebody will get this all out, and maybe if you and I ever run into each other, we can talk about the strangeness of this moment.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Thank you, man. We'll be watching you. Take care, man.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay. Bye.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Bye.
    <br>
