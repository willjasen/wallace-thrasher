      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I hooked a pulley up to try to, uh, Jerry rigged the thing. I have no idea, a hash is for a lock. Well, if it's multi-purpose is what the science said, and that's what my understanding was. Okay. If I put a pulley on there, and I affixed a bracket on there, right? Alright, as far as I know a hash is what you would put on a door or a lock is set. But using anything as a pulley, I would not have suggested that, uh,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> that's kind of a broad thing when you say multi-purpose. What about foot and putty up there? That probably wouldn't work either. Well, what do you want me to do? You're telling me to take the whole thing down and crack the putty and take the- I have no idea. All I know, this is a prank call. I don't remember selling a hash to anybody. A prank call. So, unless you bring it in, I have no clue on what you bought. Listen, I'm trying to make a catapult. Alright?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And this hash, it's defective. Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Buddy, I have no idea what you're talking about. Do you understand you're talking to a hardware store?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know, the same hardware store I made my purchase, and I got my sales slip somewhere around here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't know what you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm trying to make a catapult here, and this hash cracked open.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm trying to make a catapult. Okay, so is there a question in here somewhere?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes. Do I need to be on or off the ladder when I'm putting putty on my pulley to get the hash back together?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Do you have to be on your ladder to put putty back in the pulley? I have no idea what you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, my catapult. I guess you better draw up as schematic.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I made a schematic before I even went shopping up there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Can you be on the ladder to put putty on the pulley? You can put putty on the pulley anyway you want to on the ladder.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It doesn't bother me. I mean, I had no idea what you're doing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Is this Wally? No.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, golly, so the schematic calls for a hasp and a bracket.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, I guess you better come in Monday because we're closing up right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, yeah? Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, so should I be on or off the ladder to put batteries in my detector?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I think you probably have a stand on your head to do it, but I don't know how well that's going to work for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm trying to get a catapult working guy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> For you? I don't know what a catapult would do for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I got about three or four bowling balls. I'm trying to transport them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Once I get this putty removed from up there. You read me?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Not at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, what part do you need me to go over again?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> The part about mummy napkin. What is that about?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's the name of my company.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay. Well, I think you need to start over with that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Look, how much putty am I supposed to rub on there?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> As much as it costs, I have no idea.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You can spend Monday and ask all these questions.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If I can fax them to you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, I don't do that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I got a slight apartment right across the street.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I got a padlock on on my putty.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Hi, Point's Hardware.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hi, I had a flea in my zephyr.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I had to eject myself out of the aircraft.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, how are you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I'm on the ground now, but I need to construct about an 80-foot tarp.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Hey, we have to call ID. We'll call you up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Whoa, I'm Michael. I got this. What? You want to do what now?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I need to shoot an 80-foot tarp off a harpoon and bring the aircraft down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, good luck with that shit.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, there were fleas in my zephyr and I had to eject myself out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm sure you can appreciate that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Now I need a big, big 80-foot tarp.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I can harpoon the thing and bring the aircraft down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You understand?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Good luck with that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You might have one, but I don't know how you're going to harpoon a zephyr down or whatever the hell you're trying to harpoon down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What size you got?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Come on in and look at them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What's the density of this tarp?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> About the same as the others.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Maybe 12 millimeter.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Or maybe I could flash in some cork bullets and just...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> The best thing to do is just like yourself in a closet and think about it for a while.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sir, I got this aircraft flying around with fleas inside, all right? Now help me out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> All right. No, I think you probably need to think this one out on your own.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And by the way, get on your medication again, will you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I need about 400 cork bullets.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Hello.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes, you guys sell ejector seats up, huh?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> We just caught it and we said no.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Have a good day.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's a shy stone starband.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What are you trying to say?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's a shy stone starband.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I need an ejector seat from a zephyr.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> How much you'll charge?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You need to get back on your medication.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're really a nut job.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> In my country, we lock people like you up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I assure you, I'm on my medication, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, no, you're not on your medication.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you were, you'd have a better job than this one.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sir, I got fleas crawling around my zephyr.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You got fleas crawling around in your head.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Help me out. I don't know what to do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, no, you need medication.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You need to swallow some insecticide.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It'll kill you and the flea.
