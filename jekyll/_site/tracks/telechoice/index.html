    <li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> This is the third goddamn call I've had today and I'm tired of it. What's a sensational offer?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> Tele-choice will go on your line the 8th of October. Okay, this is under AT&T, right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> U.S. West. U.S. West. U.S. West. Because I don't want any odd little creatures.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> Yeah, you don't want to take on any more companies. Some
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> potent companies I've never heard of. You already have U.S. West. Well, okay, but I ain't,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I've been getting calls about changing and everything. Well, maybe it's AT&T or something.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> Hello? Hi, is Mr. Dang there? Oh, he's not home now. Okay. Your mother-in-law. Oh, yes, she hates me. Trust me,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> she hates me. Your mother-in-law feels that way? Why? Because I took her son away.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> But just, just, just don't call her on three-way. Well, I only did it because I wanted to see the
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> way she felt and then she lied about it. But yeah, my mother-in-law, I mean, she should be in the
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> mental institution because she's a wacko. She was, oh, she's from Nebraska. So, you know,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> they're all backwards out there anyways. But, oh. So, trust me, it's nothing off my back.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Truthfully, with my phone bill, I mean, I check my records. So, I live in Port Orchard.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> My husband works in Banger and that's long distance. Yeah. And it's only a 20-minute drive.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So, I called U.S. West and they said because Banger is on another phone company line.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's why it's long distance. So, I think it's stupid.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Two, I hate the state of Washington. So, I hate it. Oh, come on. Oh, I hate it. I really miss the smell.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Here, it's thanks. Who are you? Who are you? I can understand English.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> How is U.S. West? How are you doing?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I don't know. I haven't taken it inventory yet. I woke up this morning.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I tell you what. You go back maybe in half an hour or so and talk to the word and she takes care
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> of all that. We're going to let you know about telechoice that we're offering. Huh? I cost 650.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> So, why should I pay extra money? Well, you're getting three-way calling in code. I'm not interested
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> in three-way calling. We don't have any use for it. We don't need a three-way hookup.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I got out of the hospital with a brand new knee-ream placement and I just does not switch it this time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> It's only $1.50 per month and then you'll have to- Yeah, $1.50. I don't have it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> How are we going to do it? Don't have it. No, let's do it the way we've been doing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Hold on, please. My daughter will pick up the phone, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't understand what you say. But I understand a little bit. A little bit.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What do you say? Huh? See, when my daughter comes, she can understand what you say.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> I don't know what you say. I don't know what you say.
