      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> For a critical massive?

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Something went very strange with this audio there for a second.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We have a gate.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> There's not a door, so there's a number on the gate for them to call when they're here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So if they don't call us, we're not going to come to the gate.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And that's because you have an audio problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I understand that, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't have an audio problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I just had an audio problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You just said to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Just you, your voice was rewinding and squeaking, so I've never had that happen before on any call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's why we've been out there three times coming up here, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, so you have to call us.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If the phone doesn't ring, we don't know you're there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What I'm doing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, so are you here now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Are you here now?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Are you here now?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm an administrator, so level three, D-HL, all right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Fantastic.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So what do you need me to do?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're basically scolding me when no one has called this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, fix your audio problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Number one, so our driver can do this job.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We don't have an audio problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> The phone rings when people dial.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You can give us a call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You've gotten through to me right now, correct?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, well, you're rewinding and whistling.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Can't really make out what you're saying.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, our buzzer works.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, because you told me it was defective a minute ago.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I know, I didn't say the buzzer was defective.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You sure did.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Your call was defective.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And you said you're under critical mass right now?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sounds like a critical mass on your intercom.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All right, so is this a crank call?
      <br>
