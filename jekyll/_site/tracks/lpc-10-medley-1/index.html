  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I needed about a hundred limes if he could sell them to me.
    <br>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I'm up in Mason City.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You're in Mason City and you want limes from me?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You realize you're calling the liquor store in Des Moines.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> What can you do for me today, sir?

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> This is Brian from Mason City.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Brian, go to the grocery store.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You can get a hundred limes there.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I'm in the car and I'm all my way right by you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't have 200 limes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> 100.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't have a hundred limes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Instead of sitting here on the phone, why don't you box them up and I'll come pick
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> them up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why don't you pick them up on your way up the street then because you're going to wipe
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> me out of limes and I don't even know who you are.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> My friend referred me to you the grocery store's plumb out.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> He said that you could hook me up.
    <br>
  </li>

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know any Leland.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't deal with anybody in Mason City.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> The problem is, if I give you a hundred limes, then I'm out of a hundred limes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If the grocery stores are out of a hundred limes, then obviously all of my normal in-town
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> customers don't have any limes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm sorry, my man, but you're going to have to go somewhere else to find some limes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I'll pay double.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Triple what you're asking for.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't care because my regular customers who I deal with every single day won't get
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> me limes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> My money's just as good as anybody else.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm arguing with that, my man.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's a very simple answer.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't have a hundred limes for you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'll call somebody else or go to the grocery store.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I'm going to cut you a check.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> It'll be fine.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I'm sorry, bud.
