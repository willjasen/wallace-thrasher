      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why don't you ask him?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, you know, but I got this page and everything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not really sure.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This is the strangest call I think I've ever had, so.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know, I don't really know the music that well.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It seems like it's pretty successful.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, it's not good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, you know, it's not the kind of music I like.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That doesn't mean it's not good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But, you know, I've seen some of the videos.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> kind of mainstream, melodramatic, you know, very catchy, very commercial, that you guys
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> saw a lot of records?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We have.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know, probably got real big houses and stuff.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, we broke up, you know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, you did?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Before the record, the first record even came out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But they were back together making millions.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, they wanted it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know, it was kind of a post-mortem, you know, notification or whatever that we got.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So we weren't even a band, and we hadn't seen each other in some time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But then, you know, they wanted to make us an offer, and we did it, and kind of tried to bury it, give a burial to all those things that were going on, problem-wise with the band.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But I just don't think it sucks, really.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, you should quit then.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> All right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But you didn't page you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Your office didn't page me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, I didn't page you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So, you know, don't know what that means.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I haven't started, I have started this, like, side project.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Enterscope is thinking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> not deal some with it. It's called But doesn't Atlantic have your leaving member rights if you quit your band?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No. Why not? Because I was the last to join. They actually, when we rejoined, they had briefly had another bassist when we reformed. And then somehow when I, when he split the band shortly thereafter, my part didn't require any kind of restrictions on that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's cool. Good for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, you know, good with that project.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's called Budok.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, good.
