<ul style="list-style-type: none;">

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Converse, talk station, 6.30, K.H.O.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hi, Tom Martino, you are a troubleshooter.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We have more employment questions, hang on, we'll get right to you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Welcome, what's going on, Dan?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I was working, and my manager at the Denver Puppet Theater was an 80s rock fan, you know,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> J. Giles, Boston, Einster's Ende Noybout, and such.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And recently, I wore a different shirt during the Spirit of 76 Festival
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> for the band Hound, and my manager Juanita said no, no hound, a singer of that band,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> damaged my puppets, and this and that, and the other thing.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And she said, you know, pound rocks, basically, get out of here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So my question is...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Let me ask you this, this is a puppet theater, right?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And you're a puppeteer or whatever they call you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I've pioneered a new kind of rubber puppet, but basically, yes, I'm a puppeteer.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And then another question, are you a W-2 employee or are you a contractor?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Contractor?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, well, we're the contractor in theater, because most actors are contractors.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And that's why I asked, you don't have the same rights as an employee.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Isn't that right, sir?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's true.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I mean, then again, depending upon what kind of contract you might have with your employer.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, have you heard of a precedent for having a particular band objectionable and being fired on that basis?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Let's just say for arguments, they control enough that he could make the argument.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> He's an employee and should have rights.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Could they creatively tell him they don't want him to wear the shirt promoting a certain band?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I want to make a guess this time.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm guessing wearing a shirt you want is not a protective class.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So yes, you could get fired for wearing something.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You could absolutely get fired for wearing a particular shirt with a particular band on it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So they could tell you that your puppet is off bay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And if it was a Metallica shirt, they probably wouldn't.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But in your case, hound, they could.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> They could say, Dan, your puppet cannot wear this shirt anymore.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> They could.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So, you know, if you thought you were going to sewer, there's really nothing to sue for.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I've moved on.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Like I say, I've got rubber puppets.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm doing well.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I just wanted to ask.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> When you say rubber puppets, what kind are we talking about?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I can't say too much because I'm a pioneer and I invented it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You ought to get them protected if they're unique.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm serious.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know, we have an intellectual property attorney.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'll get you his numbers.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm serious, by the way.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you came up with something that's unique, rubber puppets, he would help you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> He would first of all do a search and then he could help you protect it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Very serious about that.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> OK, we got a lot coming right back.
    <br>
  </li>
