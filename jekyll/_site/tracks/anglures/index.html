    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm from beat tackle. Oh, yeah, fishing store. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. I'm a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> re-spapped T some new in town here and I was looking for a new, uh, fishing store. Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So you guys are close to me here. Okay. So I need to get a new fishing pole. Last plus I went to
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> sold me this short one, you know, whenever I reeled it in, I had fish flipping like wild off my
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> hook. Oh, they were spinning like wildfire on there. And then I went back there and he sold me a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> rod that was so long that I actually hooked some owl out of a tree. It was bizarre.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Real bizarre. So I need something that's going to do the job is what I'm trying to say.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, the only way I can figure that out is where you're fishing and where about you're going.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, I wanted to do some brackish fishing. Primarily. I'm not answering my question is whether
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you're going fishing on a pier, a bulkhead or a beach. Hey, guy, I'm up at two, two, 30 in the
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> morn, sort my worms. You know, I got hook worms, round worms, ribbon worms. I got worms going wild
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> in my in my tool shed. So I just need something to reduce jigging. I don't got time for backlash
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> on my spool. Does that answer your question? No, what I'm looking for is whether you're fishing on
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> the beach on a pier or a bulkhead. Oh, off a pier. On a pier. Are you fresh water or salt water?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're going to be doing striped bass fishing, which is salt water or you can do fresh water
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> fishing, which is large mouth bass, crappies, depending on what you're looking for. I don't know
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> where you're going to fish at. That's why I'm asking you where or you're going. Well, brackish.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So you're fishing in rivers. So you're looking for something about a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> native nine foot fishing pole. Okay, whatever you recommend. I mean,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, well, the only thing I could tell you to stop on buying will go from there.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I want to look into maybe using some buzz bait or bug tail. You got any of that up there?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I do. Something where I could do bottom bouncing under my boat there.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, once again, you have to come down so we can figure it out. I can't do anything on
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> phone because you can't see it. Well, this is a subcast bait and tackle Monday through Thursday.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We're open 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. You want to tell me? What's the bag limit? What was that in the
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> background that I just heard? I thought that was on your end. No, I was on your end.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, hey, I'm the only one here guy. Atlantic Bay. Who is this? Atlantic Bay. Atlantic Bay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Wow. Who is this? Pete? No. Who's on the phone? I'm Steve. I don't know who's doing this.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Somebody's playing games here. What?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Up front bait and tackle. Hey, guy, I'm sorry. We keep getting cut off here. I'm just trying
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> to figure out what's going on. I keep getting hooked between you and another bait and tackle
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> store. I don't know who you're trying to call, but I don't understand this and I'm not going to
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> deal with it any longer. So at this point, that's twice it's happened and other tackle stores are
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> answering in the background. Either you call them one place at one time, or this is a complete
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> scam because all of a sudden there was three people on the phone from one from Atlantic Bay
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and somebody else says, who are you and what do you want? Okay, what time do you open up there?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's the last thing I need to find out. Five o'clock in the morning.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, and if I want to pick up a shole, for instance, can I get a downrigger from you or a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> fish finder? Fisherman's supply. Fisherman's supply. Can you hear me? Yes. I don't know what
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> this is, but this guy that's calling me is calling you at the same time and this is ridiculous.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I mean, I'm not trying to... I did not call you. Somebody else did. They called me and then they
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> called you at the same time. I don't know if you've got the same phone number coming through your
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> phone numerous times, but I just did. I apologize for this. I'm a beaten tackle store up north and
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I know that who you guys are. Fisherman's supply is very popular and I apologize, but I'm not the
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> one doing this. Okay, yeah, all right. Yeah, I don't know what's going on, but yeah, I appreciate
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> it. Yep, no problem. Okay, thanks.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I found a beaten tackle. I was looking for some barbs or what kind you would recommend.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What kind of barbs are you looking for? Well, that's what I'm trying to find out. What kind
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you got and how much they are. What are you trying to do with it? I'm trying to fish.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Your first thing in the long run.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yo, who's this? I don't know. I can't see it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Let me three guesses. Who's this? I don't know who's on the phone right now because some guy keeps
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> playing games with my phone over here and I'm getting a little pregnant. This is Atlantic
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> bait and tackle. Did he bait? I got bait. Hey, Pete, how you doing, Pete? This is, uh,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> all right, listen, I'm from a front beaten tackle. I did not call this number. Somebody else called
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> this number and he connected it to a bar. All right, no problem. All right. Hey,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> hey, Pete, have a good day, man. Sorry about that. Yeah, you do buy that, right? Bye-bye.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yo, front bait. Can you hear me?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, it's walnut farm. Yes, hello. How can I help you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Who is this? This is the bait and tackle store. You know, I'm sorry to say this, but I,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> somebody's playing around with our phones. They've been calling me. Sorry. Somebody else
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> said together and the two of us, for some strange reason, they're hanging up. We're getting
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> connected. I don't know what's going on. It's driving me crazy. I don't know if you're getting
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> over and over and over and over and over again. No, I'm not. So the gentleman said that somebody
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> was going to go on the phone that needed to buy some bait or some tackle and then you came on.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Sorry. I'm sorry. They're doing the same thing to me. I'm a beaten tackle store myself.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. This is what they're doing. They're playing games with the two of us and they've been doing
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> it now for about a half an hour. So every time the guy calls me, he calls me first, then he calls
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> another store and then when we pick up, he hangs up. That's driving me crazy. But I'm just letting
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you know what's going on. I don't want you to think it was me calling you. But this is, this is
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> about a six-foot hole in a row that I've gotten. Well, I'm glad that we straightened that out.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I just don't want to see it keep happening to you too as well because this would really be
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> a ride to both of us. Because the cutting, the number comes up unavailable. So they're
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> right. And it's coming over here as a private number. Yes. Good afternoon. I try calling it back
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and it won't go through. Oh, right. All right. Now we got a third one. I don't know if you heard
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> them. Can you hear him in the background? Yes. Hello. Hi, this is tight lines fly fishing.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hello. See, now they did it again. They got three of us connected. Do you hear that?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello. Yeah. Hello. I'm looking for night crawlers up here. I'm sorry. I didn't catch any
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> rich tide bait and tackle. Anybody there? Yeah. I got you now. This is tight lines fly fishing.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We don't have any live bait at all. I'm sorry. All right. This is Captain Eric with salt water
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> therapy chargers. I'm out fishing right now. I'll give you a call when I return and have a great day.
