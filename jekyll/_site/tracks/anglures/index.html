      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, the only way I can figure that out is where you're fishing and whereabouts you're going.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, I wanted to do some brackish fishing primarily.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's not answering my question is whether you're going fishing on a pier, a bulkhead, or a beach.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hey, guy, I'm up at 2.2.30 in the morning, sorting my worms.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What I'm looking for is whether you're fishing on the beach, on the pier, or a bulkhead.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, off a pier.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You can be doing striped bass fishing, which is salt water, or you can do fresh water fishing, which is largemouth bass bass,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> crop east of town, which you're looking for.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's why I'm asking you where are you going.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, brackish.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So you're fishing a river.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So you're looking for.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I want to look into maybe using some buzz bait or bugtail.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Somebody's playing games here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What?
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I keep getting hooked between you and another bait and tackle store.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know who you're trying to call, but I don't understand this, and I'm not going to deal with
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> it any longer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So at this point, that's twice it's happening, and other tackle stores are answering in the
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> background.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Either you call them more than one place at one time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, this is a complete scam.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Because all of a sudden, there was three people on the phone, one from Atlantic bait, and
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> somebody else, say, who are you and what do you want?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, guy, what time do you open up there?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's the last thing I need to find out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Five o'clock in the morning.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, and if I want to pick up a shoal, for instance, can I get a downrigger from you or a fish finder?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Fisherment Supply.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know what this is, but this guy that's calling me is calling you at the same time, and this is ridiculous.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I mean, I'm not trying to, I did not call you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Somebody else did.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> They called me, and then they called you at the same time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know if you've got the same phone number coming through your phone numerous times, but I just did.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know, I apologize for this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm a bait-and-tackle store up north, and I know that who you guys are, Fisherman Supply is very popular.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I apologize, but I'm not the one doing this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, yeah, I don't know what's going on, but I appreciate it.
