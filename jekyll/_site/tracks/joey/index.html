      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello. Hi, my name's Jethro with United Parcel Service. How are we today?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I'm okay. What's just about?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, we've had a package delivered out there a couple times in the last few days,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> but no one was there to respond or sign for the item or pay for it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Where are you delivering it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I'm not a truck driver. I'm management here at UPS, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So if you're going to be around today, we can send the driver back out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Who are you looking for?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, my name's Jethro with UPS.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yes, who's the package to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's COD from Peterson Products, and just looking for someone to sign,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and next time you're there with a credit card or check,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> we can dispatch the driver once again.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Is there any reason why no one's been there the last three days?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> When are you open, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I was...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Where are you delivering it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I'm not a deliveryman, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm in management here at UPS.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And like I say...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I say, you don't even...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I know, but you haven't told me who the package is, too,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> or what the...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> What the...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> What...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Or the address. Like, how do I know who you are?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've told you, I'm Jethro Hormor
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> with United Parcel Service here, 12 years on the job.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Well, that's all fine, but tell me who the package is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm not a truck driver. It's going to Mr. Rodala, and like I say, we've made
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> two or three attempts and no one responded. What would you like us to do, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I would like you to be honest with me about why are there all these sirens going off in the
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> background? Why do I think that this is, why do I think this is a scam? A scam? At UPS, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no. Like, I know my UPS driver, actually.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I think that this is a scam, no, no, no, no, no, no. So if I call back this number, and could I report you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, is this the number that you're calling from? Well, I could report you to my district supervisor for non-response.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, please do. Oh, yeah? Please do. Then you'll get an interruption in your delivery service. Now, how are you going to like?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> that? I seriously doubt that because I knew, I know my, I know my, I know my, I know my UPS guy, and, uh, she, we've, we've, we've been in our shop the last few days. This is a total scam.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, I know my rights. I hope to God that, I'm Jethro Hormone with UPS. And I've been here for 12 years on the job. You understand that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Uh-huh. How long have you been at your job, Joey, or whatever your name is?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> All. Hmm. You don't know? It's not in your file? I don't have it on the tip of my,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> fingertips? No, sir. Oh, there you go. Okay. So, I don't know what to tell you. Our UPS guy has been by.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> There's there's been no notification left at our door or anything else. So I'm pretty sure that this is a scam,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> and I'm going to report you, and I hope you don't do this again to other folks, because this really is not fair.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Everyone needs to make a living, and I perfectly understand that. But, but this is, this is, this is a
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> is the wrong way to do it. This is a scam.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to talk to my archdiocese and see what he has to say about you, because I don't like
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> where you're coming from here today. I'm at UPS. I'm a manager.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yep. And you can't even tell me when you're going to be back in the office to sign for your item.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What am I supposed to do with that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I really hope that you'll stop doing this stuff. And, you know, good luck.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello?
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I wanted to get to the bottom of it here today.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Listen, this isn't a good time to call. Can you call me on Monday?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, no, we've been out there three times, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Have you got a check prepared for our driver?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yes, I do. Send them by.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Monday's a holiday. So how about Tuesday morning?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Tuesday morning. Great. Have them come there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, and if you want to just read the routing number or Visa card account number now, we can get that settled here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> You know, I'm right in the middle of things. I don't have it, but if you send it by on Tuesday, I will have it there for you, okay?
