    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay. But these are coated with some special. I don't know what they're coated with, but they're coated with stand just about any temper tour, any temper tour at all. So they said that you're nearby and you're an expert on this and got a real green thumb and all this kind of thing here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And so you said they're coated with some kind of temperature? A repellent of some kind. Oh sure. Yeah. They got a repellent on there as some kind.

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know what it was. A repellent of some kind. Huh? What's your issue with them? I'm just trying to get them up and running.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It is like minus 10 outside right now. It's not really a growing season. That's probably why. What do I need to do over here?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> We call springtime. It's winter. There's about a foot of snow right now. So they're not going to grow right now for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh no. What if I just waited out the whole waiting game? Wait a real long time. Yeah, you'll be waiting until the snow melt. Yeah, we have like a foot of snow. They're not going to grow yellow. What's that? Hold on a second.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. Hello. So you want to come to pick it up? No, I'm not going to look at them because they're not going to grow.

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> 11 and one o'clock. You got it. Why? That's funny, but me, I'm not listening. I'm not going to force you to think what you're going on. Of course not. You don't want to. You don't want to. That's fine with me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Wayne, just bring a few boxes. You know, I'm going to pay you for those boxes. What are you worried about it? You should always have boxes that you open it up the way you want it. That's the end of it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I was copying that. That is great. You need to bring boxes. No, I'm talking about when you'll be 95. You're going to talk like me too. Excuse me? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've got to defend you. Okay. Okay. So you're going to be with 11.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So I was talking to Wayne Frisbee there just a moment ago. You don't need five or six boxes. I don't understand what you're saying. Okay. Okay. No problem. I know what I'm talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes. Who is this? Yes. Is it Mr. Frisbee? Who? I think you have the wrong number. I don't know why you're calling me then. I didn't call you. What the heck? Hello? What is that down? Sorry. Why don't you call me to six, five, five, five, three, seven, two?
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Who are you anyway? Who are you anyway? What? Who are you? What the? Who do you think you're talking to? If I don't know you, but I want to give you my name. You called me your name. You didn't give me your name. But I want to know who you are before I give you my name. Oh, you're the one. What you called me? I never called you at all. What is your phone number? I'm not giving you my phone number.
      <br>
    </li>
