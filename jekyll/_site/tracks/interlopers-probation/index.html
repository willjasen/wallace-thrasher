      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Me? I never ordered Chinese. He said the... Are you David?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> It didn't just slip around. I'll hang up. Thank you. I didn't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Hello? Can I repeat this order to you to make sure I have it right? Are you David?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> In order to this, I'm not the person. I just woke up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Okay. So who are you? You call the wrong number. Go by.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I think it's a great call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Hello? Hello? What's this? Hi. This is Eddie. How are you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Who are you? What's that? Who is this?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Somebody from the Houdel called and said something about you were looking for somebody with loss from the 50s.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Well, this is not me. Okay. Well, then... Stop calling.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I moved here in January in a motel, okay, until I get a apartment.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Now, if I had a apartment, this would want to be happening because somebody from here is doing this crap.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And it reminds me of Boise when I had this problem in Boise.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Somebody's trying to make me pay for something and doing fraud.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And then for the other motel, it was that in Boise, it was run by Indians, those people I can't stand.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> You know, I tell them close calling and trying to get a free mail because I don't know the people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I don't even talk to the people in the motel because a lot of them are trash and low class scumbag.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> So, and they're trying to get money from me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And I don't even talk to the people in the motel. I don't make friends in a motel.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> So, somebody in this place is doing this. I don't know who it is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> But I'm going to call the police. And when the police comes around, they're going to go to jail for this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> It's an authority. I don't need to describe. But if this keeps happening, I'm going to move out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I'm going to go to another motel because this is an authority.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> You know, I tell the office, you know, what are these people calling?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Don't connect me to my room. I don't know these people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And I know show business people, but I don't let them call here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> So, I call them for private people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I don't know who they are. The 50s and all that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I'm 50 years old. I wasn't there in the 50s.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> So, if somebody does this again, get their name and get the right person and then call the police on them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And then it's press charges.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Because I've been to that eating place in January in February.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I've been eating there for a month now. So, I wouldn't be there for a while.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Somebody calls from a Chinese place and say I owe it to Chinese.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> When I didn't order Chinese, I just woke up about 10 minutes ago.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I've been sleeping trying to kill the day faster.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> So, the bad weather makes me have problems.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> So, I don't want a lot of people calling this room.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I don't have anything I call them, people like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> They're not smart.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I wanted somebody to send me to school and graduate and went to college.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> So, try to find out who it is. And when they do it again, call the police on them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And I'd love to see them go to jail.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> They're the ones that put on the event.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
