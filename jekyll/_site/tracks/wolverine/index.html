    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> That is weird.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Okay. I guess, I guess we can see what's going on. Yeah, I'm just going to hang out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Okay. Um, I'm sorry to keep you holding. So- No, no, no, no.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> You said the book is called wolverines. Is called what now?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Okay. Did you call about the book wolverines? No, I haven't called about anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Oh, I guess I picked up the wrong line maybe.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> Well, um, a gentleman just phoned me and said that he was looking for a book entitled
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> kidney beans. Wow. And that someone had picked it up here at this shop at kaboom books.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> Oh. But this I do not know. I don't know that the title that he gave me, I have no idea.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> So I asked if he had an author on it. And I think- You have an author?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Well, I'm, I'm sorry. I'm, I'm not understanding what you're asking because you're telling me-
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> I'm not asking anything. I'm trying to answer a question asked by the gentleman who is on the line with you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Oh, okay. No one's on the line with me, I don't think.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Oh, really? I just decided to find a book. Someone called and asked for a book.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> No, someone called me and asked for a book.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Oh, this is very confusing. I think I picked up the wrong line. Hold on just a minute, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Hi, this is Valerie. What, what can we help you with today, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> Um, nothing at all. I had a gentleman just call me and ask me for a title, kidney beans,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> which I have never heard of before. And that the woman that had recommended it to him
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> had gotten it here. And so I said, well, maybe if you give me the author's name, I can run with it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> And he said, she's in the bathroom just a minute and as soon as she comes back, I'll get it for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> And then another person came on the line, whom I'm assuming is one of your store people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> That's so weird. There does seem to be something kind of cutting in and out. Like there's a line
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> in the cross. Oh, really? Wow. I don't know what that is. I don't know. Um, all right. Okay,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> kidney beans. I don't know who it is. You're saying that the title is SWAT machine?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, I don't. I just, he told me this title was Wolverine, but we don't have a book by that name.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, Wolverine. But that that's not correct. Is there some other title?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And you don't know the author? I'm not hearing you. Well, I'm not saying anything. I'm just,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> what is that noise? Um, oh, I don't know what the noise is either.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Um, he called and said that you purchased a book here and that there was more of them,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> but I can't figure out what book that is. Remember? Okay, but maybe could you call me back? I don't
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> know what that sound is on the phone. Okay.
      <br>
