      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> But he may have said Wolverine, you know, phones being what they are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> No, that's fine. So we're looking for a bright yellow book called Submarine.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> Well, I, I, the only thing that comes up with submarine for me, is.

      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> Oh, fine. That's really weird. It's not a purpose.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_14:</strong> We'll try to figure out what's going on on our end because we didn't style you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_14:</strong> I picked up this phone call, so we're just trying to figure out what's going on.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's not on our side. I mean, I don't know what it is either, unless it's the phone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_13:</strong> Okay, that's just some kind of weird interference.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_18:</strong> Yeah, if you brought it in to sell it, it's possible we would buy it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_18:</strong> I'm not going to guarantee that, but we would look at it if you brought it in.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_18:</strong> But, yeah, I don't have any to sell anybody right now, so...

      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_19:</strong> You guys called me asking if I had copies of the book called Wolverine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_19:</strong> If you had an author name, I could look that up.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_20:</strong> Somebody just called me and asked me if I had another copy of a book called Ovalteam,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_20:</strong> and I suggested that it must be a different bookstore because we're a used bookstore,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_20:</strong> so we don't have a whole bunch of copies of many books.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Was it Wolverine?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> I was just asked if we had Charlie Sheen a memoir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> I was like, I don't see that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> I think he missed a...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> Weird.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> This is weird.
      <br>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> I work at a different bookstore, and I was called to check if I had one bug.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_10:</strong> What?
      <br>
    </li>

    </li>
  
    <li>

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> It's called what now?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Okay, did you call about the book Wolverines?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> No, I haven't called about anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Oh, I guess I picked up the wrong line, maybe.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> Well, a gentleman just phoned me and said that he was looking for a book entitled Kidney Beans.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Oh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> And that someone had picked it up here at this shop, at Kaboom Books.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Oh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> But this I do not know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> I don't know that the type.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> that he gave me, I have no idea.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> So I asked if he had an author on it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Do you have an author?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Well, I'm sorry.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> I'm not understanding what you're asking because you're telling me...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> I'm not asking anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> I'm trying to answer a question asked by the gentleman who is on the line with you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Oh, okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> No one's on the line with me, I don't think.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> I just don't find it to find a book.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Someone called and ask for a book.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> No, someone called me and asked for a book.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> This is very confusing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> I think I picked up the wrong line.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Hold on just a minute, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Hi, this is Valerie.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> What can we help you with today, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> Nothing at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> I had a gentleman just call me and ask me for a title, Kidney Beans,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> which I have never heard of before.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> Oh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> And that the woman that had recommended it to him,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> had gotten it here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> And so I said, well, maybe if you give me the author's name, I can run with it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> And he said, she's in the bathroom just a minute, and as soon as she comes back, I'll get it for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> And then another person came on the line, whom I'm assuming is one of your store people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_12:</strong> That's so weird.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> There does seem to be something kind of cutting in and out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Like there's a line in and across.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Wow.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I don't know what that is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Um, all right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Okay, kidney beans.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I don't know who it is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You're saying the title is SWAT machine?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, I don't, I just, he told me the title was Wolverine, but we don't have a book by that name.
      <br>

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, Wolverine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But that's not correct.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Is there some other title?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And you don't know the author?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm not hearing you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I'm not saying anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm just, what is that noise?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, I don't know what the noise is either.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Um, he called and said that you purchased a book here and that there was more of them,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> but I can't figure out what book that is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You didn't remember?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But maybe, could you call me back?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't know what that sound is on the phone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.
