      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello, this is Schneider. You sold me a guitar about ten days ago.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, what guitar was that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Defender. It was from my brother's birthday.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And it's got some weird stuff going on with that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you want to bring it in, we'll be glad to look at it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Maybe we can find another one. What's wrong with it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We got home and we opened the case and there was a bag of frozen blueberries inside.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Frozen blueberries? This was a new guitar. I thought it was new.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It was frozen blueberries in this guitar case. That is a new one. I can't say I've ever heard that one before.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I want to say everything he plays just sounds all sour and it just sounds bad. It's nothing like it was in the shop.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have no idea. This is what guitar was this?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Defender.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What's Fender?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> acoustic, electric, telecaster, Stratocaster?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It was your standard made in Mexico.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'll just look it up. What's your first name?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This is Schneider. My brother's name is Wade. I bought it for his birthday. I paid cash.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Okay. What's your first name?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hey, I could be in there playing a whole lot of love in 30 minutes, Guy, but it's going to sound like a whole lot of noise because this thing's fouled up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You got me?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. I actually don't, but what's your first name again?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What's the problem?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What's your first name? So I could just look up what instrument it is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Here, can I just put you on the phone with my brother Wade?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm just curious what guitar so I can look it up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's a Fender.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What's your first name? You don't remember me?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, we do see a lot of people. If you just give me your name, I will look it up and see what the story with this guitar is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Schneider, I told you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Schneider's your first name.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to put Wade on the phone. And these blueberries were dated March of last year, too. That doesn't make any sense.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, so Schneider, your first name?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Wade is my brother's name.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's how old these blueberries are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And it was slimy in the whole space.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know anything. That's what I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So, your first name. Can you spell your first name?

      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm going to ask you one question because I'm aware that you just took up a lot of one of my salespeople's time when we didn't get anywhere.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Be hearing about the call to cops and tell them that you're calling us because you're not giving us any information.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You understand?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm not going to let you do this anymore.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So I'm going to hang up with you and you're not going to call back unless you're going to call back the useful information in a rational mind.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> How does that sound?

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> How do you spell that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just like it sounds.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, the SCH, but that's not why.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I can't tell how it sounds.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> SCH, Schneider.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I bought a made-in-Mexico fender for my brother in cash from Peter.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I understand that, but you're just leading Pete on a wild goose chase here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'll just try to do it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Find out your name.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What are you talking about?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I figure out why your phone keeps ringing here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> A wild goose chase.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So I'm going to hang up and if you can get your phone fixed up, please don't call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to fix your face.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, God.
