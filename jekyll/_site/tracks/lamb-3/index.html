    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> May I help you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello, Bank?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, hi.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What do I do about checks that are coming to my home for someone who moved months ago?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know, cancel checks and whatnot.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You could either put return to sender and just drop them in a mail slot and they'll return them to the bank.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm seeing, too, how much they got in their account.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Not all that much.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Or if you come to the bank, just, you know, drop it off here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, I don't live that close to the place, but...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Just wait on the front.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Return to sender, and then they should return them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> turn it, you know, right to the post of the addresses up on the upper part of the envelope.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, it'll come back to you guys.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Uh-huh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> All right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But you'll keep sending me these statements, checks, and whatnot.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, because once we get the back, you know, that they don't live there, then we will, you know, cancel that address.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You'll stop sending it to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Would that be the Christian thing to do to return it to you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I mean, I could throw it in the trash, too, but what would be the Christian thing to do,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> them?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, you know, the best...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Jesus, I think, would...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> ...and if the country would have it, we would have it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, these things are starting to come, and there's no money in them, but they're canceled checks, and I'm sure if they want them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So if I could read just a couple passages from the Bible to you here, that might kind of, you know, seal this agreement to us.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's glory be the day that our Christian saviors come forth from the Holy Land and bring us good news about our Savior of the Lord Jesus Christ.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Do you think this woman is a Christian woman?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I mean, should I even bother returning her check to her? Who knows what she could be, you know?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, that's something you would have to be.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> have to decide. You either return it to the bank or you can destroy them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Is it a Christian bank?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It is a Christian bank? Okay. Now, there are several other passages that I think, you know,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> pretty much wrap up this whole check ordeal.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Frankly, I've got a stack of them here, and I don't know what really to do with them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But I tell you, they're trash them or return them. So the blank lamb is coming forth to,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you know, wash away the sins. So the blank is what you need to. So the blank is what you need to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> fill in now. So I'll ask you a passage you're doing. You'll just fill the blank
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and I'll decide whether I need the returnees. So it would be the blank lamb.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's innocent. No, no. Well, you're close though. You're close though. Think of blood and
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> that nonsense. The blank lamb. I guess slaughtered or? All you're close. You've got the first letter
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> for the first word, the word S is right. The blank lamb.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, no, no, no, don't give up. No, because you're obviously a good student in the Bible.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It ends with an L, S, and it ends with an L.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I really don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, you just keep going.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, no, that's okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Because, you know, we're talking Jesus.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm sure that woman is a good Christian herself, and she'll, you know, understand.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You might want to relate the conversation we're having with her, too.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So you're almost right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So S and think of blood.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Blank lamb.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Starts with an S, ends with an L.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Four syllables.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I really can't think right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, you know, just take your time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just know, you got it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Because I have a customer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I understand.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I can talk to the customer about the same issues, but.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, I can.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I put one with the customer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, can I give you a multiple choice then?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We'll wrap this thing up real quick.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It would be either surreptitious, serendipity, or sacrificial?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It would be sacrificial.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Very good, sacrificial lamb.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Let me just, I just go one more passage.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just let me read this one more passage.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'll put this whole lot of checks right back in the mail to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Can I do that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Fine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> He spaketh not unto thee.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Comeeth forth from the Holy Land to bring us the news.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Say not unto him that the blank of Jesus washes away all of our sins.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, now that's your blank again.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's your love.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, but you're close.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Think of washes away.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What would be blank washes away?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> The crucifixion, the whole ordeal.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Think of the whole scene.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Don't keep the woman waiting.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> The blank of Jesus.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What would wash away sins to purify?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> The blood, I guess.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, that's right.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's very good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Let me just read one more paragraph.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> from the Bible to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, yeah, well, I really have to finish with this customer right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, so what would you rather have?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Something from Psalms, Hebrews, or...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I really don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, you mean, you could pick anyone at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I know, but like right now, I have this customer that's waiting.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I could just go ahead and choose something from Proverbs, if you'd like.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Fine.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> He's saying that's under him, have us not speak with forked tongue, unto the less Jesus will pray for thine Savior and soul.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, blank.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So what would you fill in at the end of that?
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
