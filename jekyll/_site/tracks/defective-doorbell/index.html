    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, hey, who's this? This is Phillip. I just moved in around the corner from you. I got your number out the mailman. It's a friend of mine. I know you've lived here a while. I'm just having major problems with my doorbell. And I don't know anybody else in the area. Would you maybe just stand outside and I'll beep it and you can tell me if you hear anything. I can't get it to work. I got to fix my doorbell.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm missing out on a lot of stuff. It's not working, right? It's making sounds and it doesn't work and it rings ten minutes after I push it, stuff like that. Would you mind just stopping by? I give you two, three dollars.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This might be the worst scam I've ever heard. Ryan, buddy, I need a hand here, guys. This is not a scam.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What are you talking about? I'm Phillip. Who are you? I'm Phillip. I don't have a clue who you are. I offered you two, three dollars fair and square. I'll have a clue who you are, dude. Get your life in order. I live two down from you. I just live two down and I'm trying to put a doorbell on my tamper here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know anybody in the area. What do you want me to do? I don't know how you got a number from the mailman. He's a good friend.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Why would the mailman give you a phone number? He's a real straight shooter, real good guy. Why would the mailman give somebody's information out?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> My doorbell is freaking out, dude, and I'm missing my newspaper and I'll just come on by and I'll pour a couple backwards. How's that sound, huh?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm all set. Sound good? I said, I'm all set. I don't have a clue who you are and how you got my number. Please don't call me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just come over, give me five minutes to get dressed and then just come on over.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why am I entertaining you? I'll give you two, three dollars. Hello? Dude, it's Phillip. I'm just going to come over to your place so we can take a look at this thing.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're calling from a Oregon number. Now you're calling from a Colorado number. Stop. I don't want it over. I'm coming over.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't want it. You're not coming over. Why not? If you come over here, I'm going to let my dogs come out and rip your dick off.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Don't come over. Don't kick your foot. What do you think of that? I don't have a clue who you are.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I got a doorbell in hand and we're going to take a look at it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Also, get your life together and fit it yourself. I need your help. I'll bring the beer. I don't care. We'll drink a couple beers as I sound.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't want any of your beer. I got a doorbell on the fritz here, guy. It's not working, Ryan. You hear what I'm dealing with?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello? Hey, Ryan. I couldn't hear your ring on the bell. Are you coming over or not? This is Phillip.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have no idea who you are. You called me from three different area codes. You called from three different area codes, man.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But this is the worst way to ask anybody for help. I don't have a clue who you are.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't like you having a rough time, rough go at things, man. I hope you get your doorbell worked out, but I don't have a clue who you are and I don't want to know.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're going to be very upset with the dogs in the front that are going to greet you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I think I know it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I think it's obviously not a real person.
    <br>
