      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Somebody's screwing with the phones.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> They do this all the time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> They cross-connect people who don't know anything about each other.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And they just mess with us.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So you'll have to bear with it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> They'll probably try again once or twice and just hang up on them.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Gotcha.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> driver was there.
      <br>
    </li>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's from pullups.com.

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We've been trying to deliver for the past seven days.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I don't, I don't buy pull-ups, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, it's none of my concern what you do, where you order from.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm just trying to get your parcel to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Do you know Wendell, our driver?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> No.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> OK, because we're sending him back out there one more time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If no one's available, we'll just be returning the item at that juncture.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So what is the best time to be there tonight?
      <br>
    </li>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Can you appreciate what that means?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I appreciate what that means.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I think that I should be informed as to who this is delivering for.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> If you know my name, if you know who ordered this and, you know, the address.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Because that would be helpful.
