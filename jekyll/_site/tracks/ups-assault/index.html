      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> They do this all the time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> They cross-connect people who don't know anything about each other.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And they just mess with us.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So you'll have to bear with it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> They'll probably try again once or twice and just hang up on them.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If no one's available, we'll just be returning the item at that juncture.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So, what is the best time to be there tonight?
