      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_20:</strong> Okay, what are you looking for? Sorry, man.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_20:</strong> what they're looking for. I think maybe it's got mixed around. Sorry about that. I don't think we have a book
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_19:</strong> to what's called, it's about livestock. I don't know. I'm not sure. They were, they were asking me if we had a book called

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_19:</strong> livestock and... Okay, I don't think we align with you, it sounds like. So...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_20:</strong> Sorry. I don't think that's us. Yeah. I'm going to try to switch back to the Warlock guy.
