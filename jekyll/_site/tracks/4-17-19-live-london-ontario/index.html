      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I used to have sort of unorthodox methods for getting phone numbers to call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So say I had Dave's number here, and I'd go to call him, but I'd change the last two numbers and see who I got.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And that was how I got George's bar.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> cell phone number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And he liked to talk and talk and act tough and get all tough.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And so I called him a lot.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And he had a very unfortunate shootout at his establishment a couple years ago.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> No, I don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I don't really know where to get that, but if he kind of wanted some Latin inspiration,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> like, you probably listen to, like, Sabu Martinez, has some great impression.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Sounds good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Got to run.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Oh, we got another one here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Oh, do you have a question?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Yeah, I was kind of curious.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> Like, you've got a lot of people that you call repeatedly and repeatedly.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Is what you're doing kind of like a form of intimacy for you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Or is like, do you find you get too close to people sometimes and you have to back off?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> The question is, the people you call repeatedly, do you ever feel too intimate with them?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And do you have to back off?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, I had an experience once when I was a teenager.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> They used to have a thing person-to-person calls.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> If you called Collette,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> to a specific person, then they would either accept or decline it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And I ended up talking to this woman operator for about half an hour,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and she ended up calling me back at home and talked a lot on the phone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> We were supposed to meet one time, and we never did that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But, oh, yeah, you know, you get into these situations, yeah.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Let me just have you talk to her, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Because she knows more about it than I do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_11:</strong> Okay, thank you.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, wait, here.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, hey, can I get any regurgitation at all?
