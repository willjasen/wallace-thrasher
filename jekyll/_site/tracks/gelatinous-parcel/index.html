      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello, this is Quincy at Airborne Express.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I drive a moped for Airborne Express.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've been trying to bring a delivery up there since Friday and no one answers the bell when we come up there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Upstairs? I look downstairs.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> In fact, I heard crashing and banging and real loud noises when I was there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, what address are you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, I'm on Spear Boulevard and it's going to have to be tomorrow if we do come back at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Who are you looking for?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What's your information?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It says Paul. I mean, I can read my own writing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, okay. Well, I'm just asking you. I didn't know I was getting that delivery.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's from homolasses.com.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I didn't order anything from homolasses.com.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's come a long way and you're looking at a surcharge since we've had to come out there three times.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I didn't order anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, it says here you did and I've worked here nearly six weeks, so I think I can read the slip.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, what's the name on foot?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Paul Rathchild or something or other. I don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But what you need to concentrate on is quieting down the next time we come back out there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You read me?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Quieting down. What are you talking about?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I didn't even know what was going on if there was a drum circle or what was going on there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You had some chaos.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What the fuck are you talking about, man? There's no fucking drum circles here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Could have fooled me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Quiet house, man. What house are you looking at?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Look, you're looking at a surcharge if you want us to come back out there, period.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This isn't how airborne expression is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Get back out there. Where are you going? Are you fucking idiot, man?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Listen up, how?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're answering my question. You're giving me a hard time on the phone. Nobody ever came in my house.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I've been here all fucking day.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've been out there twice.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And you were making so much doggone racket, no one even heard me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're fucking with me, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know who the fuck this is, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But you don't even tell us you were really a deliberate guy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You'd be like, I went to this address and you would show me the address.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, I'm on 15th right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, I'm coming off.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know what the heck you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You ordered from homeolasses.com.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, I didn't. You're not even giving me any of the information, man. You're just fucking with me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know who you are, what kind of points you're through, but I'm not hanging up now, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm Quincy with Airborne Express.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This is a fucking joke.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What do I need to do to get your attention? Quiet down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Come to the door.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Don't leave my name, my first last name, which you said already, but the address.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm on Spirit Boulevard.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm on Spirit Boulevard.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, I don't know what you're at.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> My name's Quincy. I work at Airborne Express.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I drive a moped. And this stuff's marked as gelatinous.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So that's another surcharge you're going to have to pay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, you're full of shit, man. I didn't order shit, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You got too many...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You got too many strikes against you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You just do that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're full of shit.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You calling me over and over again? Fucking with me. That's the problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sir, could you please be professional?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, fuck no. I'm not being professional.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You've got a gelatinous parcel here, and there's a surcharge involved.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're not gelatinous parcel. You are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And there's a lot of commotion.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> When our driver came up there...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're full of shit, dude.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know what the fuck kind of joke this is,

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you've got a radio show or something.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, we're not on the air. We're Airborne Express.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Airborne Express is a joke.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's my ass. Just fuck off, all right?

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, dude. I don't know. You're full of shit, man. I don't know what they're anything.
