      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> time is all.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> donation to cover the other Ubers that we'll be sending?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Only because I'm not really sure who you are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Uh-huh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And if this is legitimate, and I don't even know you, Merle, be quite honest.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And you're asking me to jump in an Uber and go somewhere.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And then when I decided not to do there, you want to try to request some kind of a remittance.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, uh, I'm a little uncomfortable with all this, Merlin, so I'm just going to hang up on you, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm sorry. Well, I'm Merlin Mumford. I'm an old raccoon hunter.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I just have to, I just have to say.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Sure.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Did I not make myself clear?

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Go ahead.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> My question was, did I not make myself clear?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, okay, I'm going to block you now.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Look, you know, you sound fairly threatening to me, and I'm not threatening.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, well, I'm the one that makes that decision.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I feel threatened by you. So stop calling me, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Can I just tell you what we do?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, no, you can't.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And tonight, we're going to braid hair and pound on the ground. That's what we're going to do.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Or make a donation at your call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're being recorded. I just want to let you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> know you're being recorded. Just stay on the line. I was all I need you to do is stay on the line.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. My name is, my name is Merlin Mumford, and my phone number is a 97901-80. That's not the
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> number that, uh, that I just received, but just keep talking. I just need to keep talking.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're going to tattle or what?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Probably dispatch this. Let's see. How can I help you? Yes. I'm getting phone calls from some
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> spurious individual. I don't know who you is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> is, but calls himself Merlin. And he says he's a neighbor, but I'm not sure exactly who he is, but
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> it seemed a little odd. So I have no idea why his phone went to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What is he saying? Well, first he wanted to know if I want to take an Uber drive someplace, you know,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> to venerate some another. And then when I told him I had other plant, he's soliciting me for a $75 donation.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You know, I don't know who this guy is. Okay? Okay. Yeah. I mean, you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> You can just block the number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay. I'll block the number. Thank you so much. I'm sorry.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I have no idea why it went to you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> No, that's okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm so glad it did because that guy was badgered me. Like, I don't know he was.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Yeah, I would just block the number. It sounds like a scam.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay. Thank you so much. God bless you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Bye-bye.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, well, I'm not one near Maui police station. I don't know how this happens, but no, I'm nowhere near Maui. So, I mean, I'm going to hang up now, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Bye-bye.
