      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I know the voice, but I can't place it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm known as horseshoe around here, and you'll find out more about me if you make me come up.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You don't want to go behind door number two there.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, you sit tight, Charlie, and I'll pay you a visit on foot.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And we'll work her out.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> But I'll tell you what, you try to have a nice day because evidently, you're on the bad side of getting out of the fucking world today.
      <br>
    </li>
