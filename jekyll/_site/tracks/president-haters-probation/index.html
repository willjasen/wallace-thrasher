  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So he put us through together.

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, I don't mind.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What's it all about?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So I can go through the other office and tell him.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Do you want to talk to him?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't know.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> He said, no, he said, you don't know.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> He said, no, he said, you wanted to talk to me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't know what's going on anymore.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're from the sheriff's department?

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>None:</strong> Yes, sir.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Did you need the police for some reason?
    <br>

    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Are you having some kind of problem?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, I ain't got no problem.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Somebody hit my son's car.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> During the middle of the night parked out in front of the house.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So he might be using my name to talk to you about how they go about getting the insurance
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> company.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I had a run from the front office to this office.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, I'm a federal police news reporter.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Not a police officer.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm the biggest reporter.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm in charge of all the dead officers in the United States, all 50 states.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I've been there 58 years.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, wow.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Been in law since 1949.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And I don't like what's going on.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But we keep our mouths shut.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Even if I go in a grocery store and some other police officers come in there and they look,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> they see me and they see my identification on them.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I wear it on my shirt.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And they just say, hi, that's it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> They don't want nothing to do with us.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Because there's so much crooked stuff like that little boy got shot down last month.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> He was trying to cross the street.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't know what state it was because I didn't do the paperwork on that.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And the police officer pulled his gun and shot him four times in the chest.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And it just came over Nancy Grace here last night.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> He's already being fired and put life in the state penitentiary.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You want to talk to him about getting one of our units out there in front?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Is that what it's all about and to use my name?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't know what it's about.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> He said, you wanted to talk to me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So if you don't want to talk to me, then that's okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, because sometimes he uses my name and this is a hit and run.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> They tore a front headlight off the car and left the scene.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, if he decides he wants to report, have him call us and make me more than happy to send somebody out.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, and you watch your steps when you get out and I'm telling everybody,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> soon as you get out of your grocery stores in your car,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I can't leave her down because it's going to get worse.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You know it and I know it because my dad was a deputy sheriff back in the 30s.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And I joined up and let's see what it's 1949 Berkeley State Police.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm the biggest reporter, the biggest reporter that police hall of fame and police type magazine has.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I have all those records.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I just finished 1500 murder police officers in 20 years the other day.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Thank you ma'am.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You're welcome.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You have a good day, okay?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, that's a kind of business I can't.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> All right, what do you want?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Hello?
    <br>

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Now, what do you need?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, your son connected me with you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I guess he's saying that you had hit a parked police car in Glendale.

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And we're getting so many phone calls like yours here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No notification, just a telephone number.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Nobody hit no car.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> R2123.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Our three cars are out there in front of good condition.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So, I'd like to know who's pulling these jokes on us because we got other things to do.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So, I've answered a phone yesterday.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Somebody called us saying that there was San Pedro and that their father had hit a parked car in our city on Friday.

    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, but like I said, our three units are parked out there.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> One of them is banging up a little bit, but I did not make the call.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I talked to my son last night.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> He said he didn't talk to, you know, Glendale police.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Then we had, what was that?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Berkeley City, Missouri police call.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And that's in the state of Lewis.
    <br>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So, somebody's doing a lot of calling calls here.
    <br>
  </li>

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Maybe you could run my feet, too.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, but I can find you a bag of that will.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Why don't you go fuck yourself, Jack off?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't even know what you talk in the mail.
