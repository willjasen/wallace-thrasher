    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What is this in context, though, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I got your number from Luigi up at UEG.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> this is at all. Where are you talking about me supposed to pick this stuff up?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> See, that doesn't surprise me. I've lived nine years in the business, my friend.

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> but I just want to get my items back with a clean code of WD40 at this point,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> atop everything. You got me there? Christian.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You didn't know what you were looking at.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> He thought it was something else.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know, you don't understand the technicality in that aspect of it and that facet of it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So if I can get my belongings back, I won't need to go to the union and file a grievance.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I understand what you're saying, but I don't even know where the shoot you're referring to is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Like, where would this stuff have been that I would have taken it?

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> years in the business, my friend.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Like, where would this have been?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What shooter you're referring to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, my buttress, my harness, my rotors, they're all missing.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I haven't done anything.
      <br>
    </li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I would appreciate to know what this is in context to.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Where would this stuff supposedly be, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's supposed to be in my possession on my toe.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> around. Barney Blaha. Okay. Well, I don't know where those are. I wouldn't know anything about it,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> but I am at work, and I'm going to have to go talk to some people. So, if you want, you can go ahead
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and contact your union rep, and we'll take care of it that way.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hello?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hi. Yes, what can I do for you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Someone transferred you to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> About a safety harness? No?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No. Actually, let me ask you this. I was getting a phone call this morning about some sort of a safety harness issue.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What business is this? Who am I speaking to right now?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This is Keoti.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Keoti?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What kind of phone call?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I was getting a phone call from someone that they were asking me about a harness and a rotor and something else.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Since you're saying that I was transferred to you and I didn't initiate this phone call,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> can I just ask, where is this call from? Like, who am I speaking to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> what is the business?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> This is Keote production supplies, but I have no idea who I spoke to on the phone before you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> They made it sound like you were their client interested in a safety harness and then transferred you to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, okay. I understand. You're probably in the dark, too.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, cool. I've been getting a phone call this morning. Someone was claiming that I had taken some of their equipment,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and they wouldn't tell me what shoot or anything it was connected with. So, all right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I am sorry to have bothered you today.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> as it's been happening to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Not at all, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But, yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> The guy who called me claimed he was Barney.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I didn't initiate the call.
      <br>
