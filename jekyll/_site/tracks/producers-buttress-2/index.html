      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We've got a couple problems up here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Specifically, I think you picked up a couple of my pieces of equipment
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and I have yet to get them back.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm actually not sure what this is pertaining to.
      <br>

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're saying this is Barney?
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. What is the equipment you're referring to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I've got a non-agonical harness.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I've got a hydraulic buttress and a number of rotors that are all gone now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You picked them up inadvertently and took them as what you did.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What is this in context of, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I got your number from Luigi up at UEG.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I got to be honest, I don't know what the context of this is at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Where are you talking about me supposedly to pick this stuff up?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> See, that doesn't surprise me. I've lived nine years in the business, my friend.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I understand that you don't know the technicality of what I'm talking about here,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> but I just want to get my items back with a clean coat of WD-40 at this point.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> A top everything you got me there, Christian.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Who? I don't even know what this is in reference to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What business is this part of?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm a tech director. I do directing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not sure what you're asking me about. I don't know who Luigi is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, see, that's what I mean. You just didn't know what you were doing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You didn't know what you were looking at. You thought it was something else.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You don't understand the technicality and that aspect of it and that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Fast as of it. So if I can get my belongings back,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I won't need to go to the union and file a grievance.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I understand what you're saying, but I don't even know where the chute you're referring to is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Like, where would the stuff have been that I would have taken it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you're not familiar with that side of the business, I put nine and a half years in the business, my friend.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. You can go ahead and file a grievance. I'm not sure what this is in reference to,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> or who this is part of. I don't have time for this today.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've got 10 years in the business, my friend.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's great. I do too. Thank you very much, sir. I don't know where this is referenced to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'll tell you exactly what it's in reference to. It's in reference to my buttress, my harness.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hello? Christian. Speaking.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Listen, guys, let me get my harness up there real quick and quick, okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Where do you think your harness is? Like, where would this have been?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What chute you're referring to? Oh, my buttress, my harness, my rotors, they're all missing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know what you're doing. I don't know anything about this. I haven't done anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I would appreciate to know what this is in context to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You want to sit down with my union stored, or what do you want me to do?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Where would this not supposedly be, sir?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's supposed to be in my possession on my tool belt right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> My name's Barney Blaha. I'm a local attorney. I need to know what's going on around.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Barney Blaha. Okay. Well, I don't know where those are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I wouldn't know anything about it, but I am at work and I'm going to have to go talk to some people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So, if you want, you can go ahead and contact your union rep and we'll take care of it that way.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hello? Hi. Yes, what can I do for you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Someone transferred you to me about a safety harness? No?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No. Actually, let me ask you this. I was getting a phone call this morning about some sort of a safety harness issue.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What business is this? Who am I speaking to right now?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This is Coyote. Coyote? What kind of phone call?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I was getting a phone call from someone that they were asking me about a harness and a rotor and something else.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Since you're saying that I was transferred to you and I didn't initiate this phone call, can I just ask where is this call from?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Who am I speaking to? What is the business?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> This is Coyote Productions, but I have no idea who I spoke to on the phone before you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It made it sound like you were their client interested in a safety harness and then transferred you to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No. Okay. I understand. You're probably in the dark too. Okay, cool.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I've been getting a phone call this morning. Someone was claiming that I had taken some of their equipment and it wouldn't tell me what shoot or anything it was connected with.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So, alright. Well, I am sorry to have bothered you today as it's been happening to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Not at all, man. Yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. The guy who called me claimed he was Barney. I didn't initiate the call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know how they linked me through here. No problem. Does it Gloria Duterte? Is that me and anything to you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yes. Yes.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No. What was the name you just said? Gloria. And then the last name is D-U-A-R-T-E.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Duarte? No. I don't know. Do you know how she was connected with it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> No. Well, that's good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That could be weird, man. It just occurred.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> What? There's another voice on the line now. What's going on?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yes. Yes. What is going on?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I have no idea what this is. I'm going to hang up. Thank you very much for your time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It wasn't. It wasn't at my instruction. Or behest.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Who is this?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Well, I am the embodiment of God. I am divinity and humanity combined.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> You got the wrong number, pal? No. No. It wasn't. It wasn't.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> It is a defining moment, and God's people are going to be vindicated, and the world is going to be judged.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> It's final. You can take that to the bank.
