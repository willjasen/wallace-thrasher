    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm really trying to scale down from my quad droopler, but I've got two couplers going
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> on my signal and a flipper.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm just trying to condense that into one triple or maybe two couplers and a flipper
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> just to condense it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So do y'all accept coupons?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I mean, if it's something through Radio Shack, I'm sure they'll be able to, like, maybe
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> match it up either from Radio Shack website or something like that or something like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Right here, which you've got, I'm pretty sure if they have what's available, they should
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> give them something with a password, whatever you have is bring it in because they can match
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> it up for you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just bring all my quad drooplers in there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I mean, you'd say your coupon, if anybody wanted to see if we can give you money to
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> match with the coupon, say you're giving me any money, y'all probably would say break
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> in whatever paperwork you have as far as your coupon.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, just give me the money.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Give me the funds.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Maybe I can run somewhere else to pick up what I need.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So you'll just have the money ready?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> First my real estate with Garrett, how's it going?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, Garrett, what's the limit on the number of couplers I can have when I'm quadrupling
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> my signal?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't even know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I got a rubber running through a flipper.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm trying to quadruple, but all I've got are tripleers and I do have a couple couplers,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> but I'm trying to scale down and, you know, I don't have a lot of money either, so I'm
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> budget conscious too.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Is there a coupon or something I can apply towards this?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I mean, the couplers are cheap, how much is the coupler?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Do you know what kind of coupler you need?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> A rubber.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> A copper?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> A copper?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> What's the coupler's for?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, for my flipper?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> A copper.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What does it do?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've got a tripleer on it for my signal, but I'm really trying to quadruple it, so I've
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> got a rubber with the tripleer and the two couplers to reverse my adapter, basically.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I'm trying to multiply my couplers into my rubber.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> To be honest, I have no idea.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I'm not telling you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I'm not going to make something up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You can tell me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I mean.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I don't even know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> What does the flipper do?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I don't even...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, my rubber.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Okay, maybe my core, you know, I'm not going to be able to help you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, if it's proprietary, I won't share the information.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Hello?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hi.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What's going on here?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> What kind of coupler are you looking for?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> So we have couplers for coax, and we have couplers for HDMI.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sure.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I'm trying to quadruple my signal, and I've got a tripleer and a couple couplers.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> My flipper is joined with my multiplier and my rubber.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So how many multipliers can I fit with my divider before I have to get just a joiner?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I mean, you can go...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> You can go the max.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Like, if you can put all your connections together at once, then you can go the max.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> And we have a three-way splitter.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I think we might be able to have a four-way splitter.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, but my tripleer is going to end up multiplying my coupler, you understand?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So my signal will be coupled with the flipper, and plus my coupon through...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What's the coupon for?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know if you're sticklers, because it may have been expired.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Actually, there's no year on it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It just says the date of the month and the day.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Essentially, so I'm tripling my rubber.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> My signal's quadrupled, but I'm trying to run my subtractor through the coupler, so
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> that my flipper can adapt to the reverser.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And the coupon...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know if you're a stickler.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah, the coupon ends on the 25th, and it doesn't have like a valid end date.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> It may be expired right now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah, the coupon, I'm pretty sure that's expired.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Would you need to feel my rubber so that you could best advise which trickler to use?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Um...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So if you're flipping my rubber, my trickler is going to multiply the divider, and my signal
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> will be reversed down to the base of coupler to that stage.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah, I mean, we're risk attracting the coupler, and the divider, then the multiplier is just
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> going on, nothing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Your rubber's going crazy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Maybe somebody could come over and take a gander?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Uh, no, we can't spend any body off to check out your rubber.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Would you please talk to the gargler, and maybe he could have better explain it, because
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What do you mean?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm calling from Radio Shack.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We got a quadrupler on sale that multiplies our coupler with no triplet.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, that's okay because we got all that stuff.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Don't hang up on me because you're talking to one of the big boys from Hollywood, and
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> we got all that stuff, and boy, you son of a bitch.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> I'm just going to really say I can scare it up now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Um, yeah, I was calling about that tripleer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Oh, yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And you were going to talk to the gargler?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Would that be okay?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Just real quick.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Arthur, just let him know you talked to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Crime desk, we got cut off.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Your phone was hung up on me.
      <br>
    </li>
