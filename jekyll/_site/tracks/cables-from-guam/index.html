    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't know what you're talking about.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> My husband doesn't know what you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Is there anything?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> He is Dick Dale King of the Surf Guitar.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And we don't have any idea what you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, this stuff has come a long way by boat.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Do you understand?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> We don't understand this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> First of all, I thought you were talking about Christmas stuff that I just recently ordered.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Little things.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I didn't know you were talking about wires from Guam.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I don't know who would have ordered it because Dick is a professional.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I mean, he wouldn't order something and tell you that he didn't order it.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I mean, that would be a hell of a thing to do to somebody like that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So I don't understand what's going on.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I just got home.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's a scam.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> All right.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> He's saying it's a scam.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That has nothing to do with me or anybody else.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Well, I think I can read my own handwriting, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I can see what's on the screen.

      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You know, quit horsing around.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I got no money.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I bought nothing from Guam.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I have no cases of cable.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So don't say I'm messing around.
