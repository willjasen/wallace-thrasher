  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, it's Roger there. Hey Roger. Yes. Hi. Yeah. My name's Rocco. I just live a couple
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> places down from you. How are you doing today? Do you even know where I live? Yeah, I got
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> your number from Big Red, our other neighbor. I'm just calling everyone on our street because
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm going to be letting off some holograms outside. And I just kind of want to notify
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you and let you know what I'll be doing if you look outside. Maybe just stay inside for a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> couple of hours if that's okay. And where do you live? The same street as you, sir. He told
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> me to your number yourself. Why don't you stay the street? I just moved here from Crested Butte
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> called a rattle. I'm real new like three days ago. Okay. Yeah, I'm not. I've been here a long
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> time and a Colorado number calling telling me not to come out of my house. But let's make it
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> real plain and simple. If somebody comes to my house, they may not survive the encounter.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, it's just an avatar. It's not a real person. Then it may survive the encounter if it's not a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> real person, but a real person probably wouldn't survive the encounter. Oh, no. No. What do you
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> mean there? Well, I've got one avatar of like these shrunken heads. It just looks like they're
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> flying up and down flying by. So that's what I'll be doing. I don't know who the hell you are.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And I don't know how you got my number, but I'm feeling big red. Like I said, okay, I'm telling
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you, yeah, into my house and we'll play really not in the mood to go around and around with
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you, bud. Roger, I just think we got off on the wrong foot here. Oh, I guarantee you we did. So
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you do you and your property. I'll do me and my property. If that's a problem, we'll deal with
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> it. Listen, I've just got a hologram of a kangaroo. Buddy, you continue to call me. You're gonna
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> end up in jail. You want to get into it, guy? Because I could stop by. Be my guest, dude. I tried
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> to tell you fair and square. I got a kangaroo hologram moving around. It's perfectly safe. Like
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I said, you do you and your property. Okay, anybody comes to my property and they continue to say
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> that they want to go round and round. My stuff isn't holograms.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, buddy, I'll go round and round right now.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Bring it. If you want to get wild, let's go, Bucko. Hello. This is Rocco. I just moved in down the
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> street. How you doing? Rocco. Yeah. Hey, I was given your number by the superintendent. He's a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> friend of mine over there. He's got everybody's number. But hey, listen, I'm going to be outside
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> setting off some holograms today. And I just want to let you know what I'll be doing if you
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> see me outside. Maybe you want to stay inside for the next few hours. If that's okay with you.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> What do you mean? I'm not sure what you're talking about. Oh, like I have a hologram of a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> human cannonball. It looks like he's just flying down the street. It's very realistic. Very
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> lifelike. Okay. And Luke gave you my number. The superintendent of what? Of the district. And
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> also, there's a chance the images might travel through your window. They can't come through walls,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> but it may periodically come through the window. But I'll try to keep that to a minimum. Okay. So
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you'll stay inside for a few hours, then? I'm not I'm not home. I mean, stay away from home for a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> few hours, then. Or I mean, I mean, if I need to go home, I'm gonna go home. Is there anything
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> from venting me from getting in the house? Just the human cannonball flying like wild down the street.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> All right. Well, I thought he was talking about when I did. I'm not really sure. I don't
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> understand what's going on, but I'm gonna be home when I want to go home. All right. My plug into
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> your outlet outside too. If that's okay, all right. I'm not approving you to plug into my condos
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> outlet. I'm not doing that. You could plug into the buildings outlet, but my condo, I'm not paying
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> for your shit. It's only for a few hours, doll. Yeah. So it's a few hours. I can't go to my condo,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> and then I got to pay for your electricity. No, I'm not doing that. Let me some scan, bud. Come on,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> bud. I don't even know. How did you get my number? Who's the super attendant that gave you my
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> knowledge? Come on, Jack, slap me something, bro. I've never had a phone call like this. I don't
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> know what this is about. I need to work on my holograms outside. That's all there is to it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Okay, work on your holograms, man. I mean, I don't know how this affects me. I'm going to get to my
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> house if I need to get to my house. What if the human cannonballs flying down the street? Now,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> how are you going to like that? What the fuck is it? Who are you, dude?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Rocco. I got your number from the superintendent, like I said, the superintendent of what?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> But the whole district, man. Okay. Do what you want to do. I'm going to get to my house if I
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> need to get to my house, like have fun. I don't care what you're doing, but I'm going to get to my house.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hello? Yeah, this is Rocco. I just lived down yonder from you. I got your number from Rota,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> the male lady. How are you today? I'm doing okay. What can I do for you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Good. Yeah. I'm just calling everybody on the street because I'm going to be setting off some
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> holograms outside out in front of the house. And I just wanted to let you know what I'll be doing.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah. Okay, so no problem. Maybe stay inside for a while if that's okay for two, three hours.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Stay inside? Well, yeah, just to avoid any confusion. Like, I have a hologram of like a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> human cannonball. Looks like he's just flying down the street. And I'm kind of a pioneer with
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> avatars and holograms. Okay, I'm just a little confused as to what exactly is going on. I'm a
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> little confused. Well, there's a chance that the hologram may travel through your window. It
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> can't go through walls or anything, but it may appear through your window inside your place.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But I'll try to keep that to a minimum. I mean, we have permission to do this, and
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> might should I be concerned? I'm confused. Yeah, you probably want to stay indoors.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Uh huh. Do you have permission for this? Like, oh, yeah, I talked to the male lady and everything
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> about it. She gave me a number. I'm calling everybody on the street. I'm confused as to why
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> the male lady has any jurisdiction ever when I can and can't leave my house. Well, there's
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> another avatar I have of like a kangaroo. It looks like he's just bouncing like, why, why,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> why down the street? And so I'm just letting you know, just to give you a heads up. So that's
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> why I said this. Like I said, do you have legal right to do this? I don't know who you are.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't know why you have my phone number, honestly. It's a little
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> disability. I don't I don't know where you got it from. I don't know who this male lady is.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't know why the male lady has my phone number. I don't know who Rhoda is. I don't
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> care who she is. The male person has no right to give out my personal information, like my phone
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> number and my name. I don't understand who you are. I'm upset, honestly, over this whole
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> conversation. Well, just look out and maybe stay indoors the next few days. I might I might have
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> to call somebody to see what the hell's going on. Call who? I don't know. We'll see.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Listen, I'm a pioneer. I'm just trying to work out the kinks. You understand?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't like that you have my contact information in my name. I don't appreciate it. I don't
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> care where you got it from. I don't like it. I don't appreciate it. Okay. I'm calling everybody
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> on the street guy just to give you a hat. I don't care. I'm doing you a favor here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're doing me a favor.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Listen, dude. Do your thing and we'll see. Hey, guy, I got holograms at the Ying Yang over here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I have one of a matador with like a real defiant stance. That's the icing on the cake on that one.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You feel me? I don't care what you have. So the stage item will be good to go. Understand?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, I don't. I just don't understand why you have my contact. It's still is upsetting to me
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> that somebody I don't know who has no reason to have my contact information has my contact
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> information. The second part that's upsetting is that you got it from my male lady who shouldn't
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> be giving out my information. I'm robbing his concern. That's okay, Rocco. Rocco, what?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hercules and I'll try to keep it from going through your window. I'll do my best. This is a big deal,
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> guy. Hello. Yeah, Marvin, please. Is Marvin there?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah. Hi, this is Rocco. I'm just kind of calling everyone on the street. I'm going to be letting
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> off some holograms later tonight. So I just wanted to let you know what I'll be doing. Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I moved to Flatbush from Temecula, California about three days ago. Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Who would you get my double from? From Big Red, our other neighbor said to call him and
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> call the other lady. Listen, guy, I just got holograms popping off. I just wanted to let you
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> know. That's all. I got one of like a kangaroo, except it looks like he's in a kaleidoscope or
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> something. It's about six foot tall. Guy, leave me alone, please. Is that funny to you or something?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I've got one that looks like a matador, except there's all these stalagmites.
    <br>
  </li>
