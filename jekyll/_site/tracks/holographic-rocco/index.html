      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> But let's make it real plain and simple.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If somebody comes to my house,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> they may not survive the encounter.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, it's just an avatar.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's not a real person.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Then it may survive the encounter if it's not a real person, but a real person.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Probably wouldn't survive the encounter coming in.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
