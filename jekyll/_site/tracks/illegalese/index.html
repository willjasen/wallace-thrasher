      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> What's going on there? Well, my son's a drug addict. Why did he tap your phone?<br>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        
        <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, the cops, I think, haven't tapped. I haven't done anything. My husband and I are honest.<br>
