    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Today, on getting things done, we're going to be talking about electricity.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> If you've ever come across a frayed wire, a busted outlet, even a tangle Christmas cords,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> you've been dealing with electricity problems.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Today, we're going to talk to some experts on it and get advice straight from the source,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> people that know a lot about electricity.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So now we're going to get your calls.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Vince and Parsipone, you're on getting things done. You're on the air.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hi there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hi.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah, I own a bucket truck, and so I got in there to install my midget connector.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This is the limited space there where I need to work.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I climbed up there and got my pigtail wires out, and I used my bull wheel, and I used concentric stranding.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> A lot of people use bunch stranding, but there's no regard to the geometric arrangement of it all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I stuck with the concentric stranding during insertion.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and the subsequent elongation.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And I used my ground rod to fuse my spur.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Anyway, I tricked my arrester during this process.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So with my sectionalizer,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> we're trying to reach, it's not available to take your call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Please leave a message after the...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, uh...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> On an auxiliary level.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, he's still with us.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, boy.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So we got to pass on that for a minute.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Vince, you cut out there for a second.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You cut out there for a second.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> there for a second, Vince.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm not too sure about this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hi.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hi.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So, uh, it's really an all or nothing relay at this point for the purpose of providing higher rated
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> contact with my midget connector.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> My bucket truck is going up and down with these pigtail wires and my ground rods
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> elongating, uh, with my radial circuit raceway.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> The whole channel is designed for holding conductors, so would a busway or a busway or
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> a wireway, do the same thing as my arrester.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Well, last I checked, I believe, you know, a busway,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I understand it, would be something to run some cabling.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I don't quite grasp, uh...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> What are you doing with, like, all this stuff?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I mean, I think that's, let's find out what you're doing first.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That might help, Vince.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Sure.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm installing an automatic recloser switch.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You used to open and close an overcurrent event with my autonomous photovoltaic system.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Uh,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's a backup generating source.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It has no batteries because they are designed for a minimum amount of days or a maximum amount of days.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I wanted something using my ground rod that can just fuse my spur on no notice or using my proprietary codec on a radial circuit.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, I mean, Vince, don't forget from what you're saying, you're saying ground rod a lot, that's more of a safety thing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So, yeah, yeah, first and foremost, you want to make sure you're, you want to make sure you're,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> your rod is grounded.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's important.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> And then from there, you know, there could be a number of things.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Again, you mentioned a lot to us, I think.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And, you know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> As a non-electrician, can you guys translate?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Because I didn't get any of that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> No, I haven't really worked on a, what was it?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I know we started with a bucket truck.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> A bucket truck.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I mean, I get what that does, but I know what the ground rod does, but I think that might be a little.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm in the same boat.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> A little out of our wheelhouse.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Vince, are you an electrician?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> dabble. So what do you, what do you, what, in layman's terms, what do you, what are you describing
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> here? Well, the electric current is not balanced that I'm receiving at my place of
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> resident. Sometimes, you know, the body of a person who is grounded will come in and touch
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> an energized part of the circuit. And so I wanted to stabilize this whole thing. Got
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> on my bucket truck, got my midget connector, got my pigtail wires, and using my bull wheel,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I held the tension during the installation process, used the concentric stranding,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and fuse my spurs so I could stabilize the conductor, avoid any leakage.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, if it's, if you're saying, now you're, if it's, if you're talking about your house, and I heard
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> your house isn't balanced, the current isn't balanced.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> The only thing I can think is he should stop dabbling.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah, I mean, if you're, if your, if your stuff is unbalanced, it could be a phasing.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> issue, you might actually need to even bring in con Edison.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Depending if it's a single phase or a three phase, maybe you have a phase that's just not working.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And at that level, you're going to need to definitely give Con Ed a call and make sure that everything
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> is working the way it's supposed to.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You can also just grab a multimeter and take a reading between your neutral and your first phase,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> second phase, and potential third phase, make sure you're getting 1.20 across the neutral
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and 220 across the phases.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Okay, with the auxiliary power?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Or just the correct operation in general with my relay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> My bushing got energized in this process and interrupted my ground rod.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So I'm going to go reproduce.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'll get back to let you know what happened.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Wow.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Wow.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Is there any last one sentence question that you have in layman's terms?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, about my spectrum?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You know, as it applies to presbrial broadcasting, there's two boats of operation.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And power circuits, the ISD can deliver a fixed 5B or an adjustable one point.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You can wrap that gavel up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Can we drop the call, please?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> He sounds like the dog in Ghostbusters.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Do I sound like the dog?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, no, no.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> When he goes, he sounds like Rick Moranus when he gets transformed into the dog.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That was a compliment.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Rick Moranis transformed into a dog?
      <br>
