  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes, this is Gerber with UPS, and we've been trying to deliver there for three attempts
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> now and no one's been there to sign for the parcel.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm not sure what you're talking about, this is the company that's open from eight to five
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> every day.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I hear that every day.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I don't know where you're trying to deliver.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, our driver's been there and he says that you and he have had a scuffle of some
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> kind.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> A scuffle.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> He's Bangladesh, you ma'am.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Hello, I'm not even in the offices, I'm in the Chicago area, and if he's trying to deliver
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> to Gaggle, all he has to do is go in the front door or call them and let them know that
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> there's a parcel.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> We have UPS delivered to our location every day.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, if you're not even there, I think that's part of the problem.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So step one would be for you to actually be present and accountable.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I don't.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Hang on just a minute.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm going to pay for him.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm a truck driver.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Do you understand?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> OK, I understand what you're saying.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> OK.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> No, I don't understand.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> But you said, what are you trying to deliver from?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Is it yes or no?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Are you going to be in the office or not?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's what I'm trying to get to the bottom of here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Our driver's Bangladeshi, if you need an interpreter, I just need to put in a request
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> for one and I'll have him accompany our driver.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I have no idea what you're trying to deliver.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> There's never ever been an issue of trying to deliver something to our offices from UPS.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Are you from United Postal Service?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm with United Postal Service, ma'am.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> OK.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> United Postal Service.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, please.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Hello.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I don't know what's wrong with this phone, but every time I try to say something, there's
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> an issue.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you're not in the office, you need to be present and accountable.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It'd be step one for you to actually be present for your parcel.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Do you understand?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Try, try, try, try.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Yeah, that's not going to happen.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm in Chicago there in Bloomington.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> First of all, I don't have any idea what you're trying to deliver.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And second of all, I'm at a loss.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I've never taught anybody, call me and fuck me so ignorantly as you are.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You're the one not in the office and you think we're United Postal Service.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So who's ignorant?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You or me?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And just because our driver's Bangladeshi does not deserve your business back.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I have nothing to do with it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I don't, I, I don't understand what you're saying.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I have a company and so you're with United Parcel Service?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes, I am.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm 14 months.
    <br>
  </li>

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> That's great.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And so tell me where.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm a teamster.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Where is the parcel coming from?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Who, who's sending it to us?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm trying to reach Susan at Gaggle.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And if you're not even in the office, that'd be job one is to, I tell it up.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You follow?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Because I hear this every day.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, I'm not there.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm 130 miles away from there.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Now I can't, I tell it up there.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> We have remote workers all over the place.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Big problem, major problem.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This is signature required, ma'am.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Then anybody in my office can sign for some.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Listen, show a little respect.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Our driver's Bangladeshi.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Are you now your kids saying that?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I have no idea what you're saying.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And did you walk into my offices?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Ma'am, this will be our fourth attempt.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Do you appreciate what that means?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I do.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> But this is the first time I'm ever hearing about this problem.

    <br>
  </li>

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You're just going to have to send it back.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm not fair.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>

    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> What is your name?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Gerber.
    <br>
  </li>

    <br>
  </li>

    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, we're back on that again, huh?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> So, dude, coming up on 14 months, I just had my year in the first time.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You know, I don't understand why you're getting so nasty with me.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I'm trying to tell you, I am 130 miles away from that office.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And I don't recall ordering anything that has $97 due on it.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And nor would I have ordered anything that would be payment upon receipt.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> I have no idea what it is you're trying to deliver.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Oh, I hear that all the time.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh, I don't know about this.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> This is Susan, may I help you?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes, this is Heath.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm a accountant with United Parcel Service.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm looking at a past due here.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I wanted to know if we can resolve this here today by phone with a credit card or routing
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> number.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> You know, I think you called me last week on this and I ended up hanging up because
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> the information that you give me is not valid.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> First of all, we don't order anything, COD.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And you cannot tell me who the shipper is and where it's coming from.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And we deal with UPS on a daily basis and they come into office, we have an account
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> with them.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So we would never be getting anything COD.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So I don't know what your thing is, but...
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Okay, let me know when I can speak.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And see, that's the other thing.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> The person that talked to me last week was rude and you're being rude too.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> And UPS would never talk to me like this.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You have a flag on your account.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> That's why I'm calling.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You have a problematic account.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> To receive your parcel, we do need payment.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> So we have a flag on our account and we're problematic.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes, ma'am.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Oh.
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_07:</strong> Who is that account's name in?
    <br>
