    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> It's good to hear your voice.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Matt Dillon. And I got a charity event coming up, and I wanted to invite you down.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, unfortunately, this isn't, Bill, and I wish it was. Oh, I am. I wish I wasn't sometimes,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> but it's for the society, for prevention of cruelty to animals. I have a giant boxing ring
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> that I've built. It's right off Mulholland Drive, and it's me, you, you,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Chris Elliott, and we just get in there, beat the hell out of each other, and raise some money.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I think it's a great idea, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> You know, why don't you pencil me in for the 12th of Never?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Uh-huh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> We've also got Cindy Lopper and Blythe Danner.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> They're going to get in there and just beat the hell out of each other.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Raise a few dollars.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, that's great.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Hold on a second, and then you're going to give me that minute and 18 seconds, bye.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Cobraside.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yeah, man.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> You guys got any stencils up there?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> This is your neighbor. We got a band Tweek Deacon, and we're just trying to stencil it out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't. It's not ringing any bells, to be honest.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Do you have, like, $10, $15? We get somebody else to make a stencil for us?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm not following this conversation at all. I'm sorry.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Well, Tweek Deakin is our band. We're named after that one. He's all gacked out, but it's okay. It's a cool name, and it's too good not to be stenciled, so...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I don't know what to do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Do you maybe want to hear us for a second first?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't even know what the call is about, but you're not making any sense to me, and I'm really not interested.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> We're really trying to put a stencil together.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't understand what you're calling us for. We're a music distributor. I don't know what you mean by a stencil. We don't make stencil.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> We're a new band. Let's just come up there and we'll try to see what we can put together. Does that sound good?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm not interested. I'm not following the story. I'm not interested. We're a music distributor. We're not a stencil maker.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Tweet Deacon. Do you like the name, at least?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Is this a joke?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'm confused.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Crime, yes. What kind of do for you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Yes, sir. This is Detective Flanagan, the San Clemente Police Department.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> What seems to be the trouble here today?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Let me hit a trace on the number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> On our number? What number you call on the end on?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I'm calling from the San Clemente Police Department, sir.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I don't care. What's the telephone number you calling me on?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> It's a private line, sir, for the police department.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Look, you can play all the fucking games you want because you're stupid.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Because I'm a police news reporter and all we do, we got the same thing to Harbor Division.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Your numbers call in is 213-1170, so stick it.
      <br>
