      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> This is your neighbor.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> We got a band Tweak Deacon and we're just trying to stencil it out.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't, it's not ringing any bells to be honest.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Do you have like $10, $15 we get somebody else to make a stencil for us?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm not following this conversation at all.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> We're named after that one.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> He's all gacked out, but it's okay.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> It's a cool name and it's too good not to be stenciled.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> So I don't know what to do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
