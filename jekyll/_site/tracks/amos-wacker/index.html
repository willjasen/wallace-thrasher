      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I didn't catch your name. What's your name on the person on the room that you're trying to speak to?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I can't transfer you to a room number. I need to transfer you to a name.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's not a room number.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> My name's Wendell. I need room 103.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, I don't need your name. I need the person that you're trying to speak to, the person on the room that you're trying to call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Why don't you just give me the number and I'll download myself and I don't need to waste your time?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Like I just told you, there is no direct line.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay. You said I have to go through you. Is that correct?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay. Well, then you have to go through me. And when you go through me, you have to have the name on the room.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> You have to go through any person. When you call here, you're going to, it's going to call the front desk.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> To be transferred to a room, you have to know the name on the room and we will transfer you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Transfer me then. That there's no direct line.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Go ahead. Go. I did a name on the room, so I cannot transfer you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Uh, their name is Dilbert. That is the incorrect name.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> No, it isn't. That's their nickname. I guarantee you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you knew the person, you'd know that's the truth. I know this person better than you'd do.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Do you? Smart guy. Why don't you come up and see him then?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Why don't you just put me through there, smart guy?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> How about you go to hell?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Put me through to room 103 and I don't need to talk to you any further.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Uh oh. Thank you for calling the motel 6th out gate. How may I help you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes, sir. I'm trying to reach room 103 and I need to get through now. It's urgent.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It is not urgent because you do not know the name on the room.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I know it better than you do. I'm going to let you know that you continue to call me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>None:</strong> I will call the police and let them know. And if you really do know the person, you will get in trouble.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Like, I don't understand what you're doing. All I need is the name on the room.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Dilbert. No, it is not.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Okay, well, you're calling the wrong hotel.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Sir, are you going to put through my call or not to room 103?
      <br>
