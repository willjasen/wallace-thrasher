    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> before I can transfer you to a room. There's no direct line. So what are you saying?<br>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You have to tell me the first and last name on the room. I've said this. I've stated this. I did too.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> My name's Wendell. I already told you that. I don't need your name. I need the name on the person on the room.<br>

    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> the person on the room that you're trying to call.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Why don't you just give me the number and I'll doubt it myself and I don't need to waste your time.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Like I just told you, there is no direct line.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, you said I have to go through you. Is that? Correct. Okay, well then...<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You have to go through me. And when you go through me, you have to have the name on the room. You have to go through any person when you call here,<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>None:</strong> you're going to, it's going to call the front desk. To be transferred to a room, you have to know the name on the room, and we will transfer you.<br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Transfer me that.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That's bad. There's no direct line. You have not provided a name on the room, so I cannot transfer you.<br>

    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Their name is Dilbert.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> That is the incorrect name. No, it isn't. That's their nickname. I guarantee it.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If you knew the person, you'd know that's the truth. I know this person better than you do.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Do you? Smart guy.<br>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> How about you come up and see them then?<br>
    </li>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I know it better than you do.<br>
