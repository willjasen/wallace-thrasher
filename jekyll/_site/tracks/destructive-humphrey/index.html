    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> destroyed those. So we'd love to come and show you what we've done. They weren't
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> important or anything. Well, you're talking to the wrong guy, even though it's my

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> that I don't know the answer. I don't get competitive. I don't get into that. We

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> level stuff we're doing here. Sir, I'm not questioning your capabilities. I'm

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> telling you that I am not able to make a decision without knowing what we're

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> mind. If you want to call Sharon, my office next week, when I've already

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> but I think that you crossed interstate lines and I think you'll end up at a
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> federal prison. How's that? A prison. Yeah, right. They're coming to get you, right?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Yeah, that's in fact, I'm going to call somebody right now and treat your number
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> and report you to the fence. But this is the second time you bothered me, Humphrey.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Your bananas. You hear me? Fell in your bananas and you're a fruitcake. How's that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm bananas and you're a fruitcake. I'm a patriot and I'm a businessman. No, you're not
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> you're a scumbag is what you are. Humphrey and you need to be put away someplace
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> where there's a big lock and key. That's what they need to do with you. Who's
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> talking in the background here? Humphrey, you bothered me enough for me to take
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> some action. Okay, you bothered me enough for me to stop guys like you from
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> bugging people. Just be aware of free. Okay, because you're a scumbag and a
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> fraud and a sick guy. Okay, other than that, you're a fruitcake. So pick the
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> choice. So you are fruitcake, a scumbag, a fraud, a scam, or a comment. Which one do
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you think fits you the best? I'm going to kick you in the kneecap. That's what I'm
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> going to do. Yeah, you kick me. You kick me in the kneecap. Come on right over a
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> kick in the kneecap. Okay, nine a.m. Forget the presentation. I'm going to take
