    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> in that area lately. I have a report on my desk here that apparently you were operating
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> an unsafe vehicle and did some damage to some parked vehicles in the area there. Oh,

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> that's absolutely false. It's absolutely false. Actually, I've had somebody damage my vehicle.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> to entertain. I'm not going to entertain this because my car was in fact damaged there
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> and there was someone who actually left a very offensive note on the car there threatening
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> me and sexual violence against me there and obviously has been targeting me and I have
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> the notes that they left and I will not be responding to your comments. I would like
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> to respond to with my lawyers. I will do that. But other than that, I am being targeted
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> by somebody unfairly there who I believe is a patron of that beach who is there every
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_09:</strong> single day and has been obsessively targeting me there and I am no longer again going to

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> the number. I'm sure you're busy. I don't know anybody else in the area and I got a new bike.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Is this going to be stopped by? Maybe you could show me how to ride it. I never learned
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> how to ride the bicycle. No, I think you've got the wrong guy here. First of all, my doctor is

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> a female and I don't teach bicycle riding. Well, no, I know you're not an instructor,

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> long. I'm a quick learner real quick. No, no, no, no, man. This is too bizarre. We can't have this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Well, I got a saxophone I could give you free of charges for showing me. I mean, let's know.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I can't have anything more to do with this. This is too weird and I don't teach bicycle riding.
      <br>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, what's your birth date? My birthday. Well, it's already passed. It happened last month, but
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> well, what is it? I'm seeing spheres and I'm seeing brick walls and I can't see. I'm a man. I can't see
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> over here. Okay, it's in July. I need the actual day in here. Okay, on the year is 1970.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Correct. Yes, I can't see straight. Every time I turn around, I'm running into things.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Find your file. I got a glass of water and I poured it over my shoulder because I can't even

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> see what I'm doing. It's a mess. You can call back when you're more serious. Hello? Hi, yes.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> My name's Ernie Quasimodo. How are you? Fine. What's this regarding? Yeah, I've got a few
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> hundred words written that I wanted to send to you on this reincarnated pterodactyl.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Have you been following this at all? No, I don't have any idea what you're talking about.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> It's a reincarnated pterodactyl out of the Budakan area. I've got about 500 words and just some kind
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> of low-res pictures. I'm working on getting better ones. That's really not even my forte.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm into ghosts. I'm haunting the poltergeist phenomena. Well, in that same area of the Budakan,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> there's a tranquilized chupacabra that they've got in captivity at this point in time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, you actually be better off speaking to somebody in cryptozoology. They're more
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> savvy with that type of material than I am. I don't know how to reach those folks.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> How about that euthanized ogopogo that there was recently focused? Again, you're all talking
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> about cryptozoology. You're talking about unknown creatures and things of that nature. I'm into
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> ghost haunting and poltergeist phenomena. That's what I do. Have you heard of the
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> cannibal bat? No, I have not. Hello? Hey, it's Ernie. How are you? I told you yesterday. I'm not
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> really into that kind of stuff. Buddy, I got this whole thing with this reincarnated pterodactyl.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I got it. Because it's not my expertise. Yeah, what are you working with? I told you yesterday,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> ghost haunting the poltergeist phenomena. But this tranquilized chupacabra, don't you want to
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> look at it? I've got video. Really? They're going to miniaturize this thing and send it around.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> They're going to send it to tell you to talk to somebody I told you yesterday in cryptozoology
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> that have it more of an expertise than I would. Yeah, but let's look at some video together.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> They're going to euthanize this. They got an ogopogo at the bootycon here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Yes. Hey, I'll tell you what, I'll send you a PayPal payment just as a deposit. Just send
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> you some video and have your opinion sent back to me. Send me an email. I'm not an expert so I
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> can't give you the next part of opinion. On which one? On any of them. I'm not a cryptozoologist.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Don't you understand that? Yeah, but you're interested in the pterodactyl, aren't you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> No, I'm not. I'm interested in ghosts, hauntings, and poltergeist phenomena.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Okay, well, then this video of the chupacabra is going to drive you wild.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Capra is a cryptozoological manifestation. It has nothing to do with ghosts, hauntings,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> or poltergeist phenomena. Okay, but I talked to Gavin Conklin. That might be fine with him,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> but I don't know anything about Gavin, whoever you just mentioned.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Gavin Conklin said that you could appreciate my videotape that I got here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I don't even know Gavin, so I don't know how he's recommending people to for me to look at
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> cryptozoological stuff. They're going to euthanize a dragonfish if I don't get together with you here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I really don't want to get any more into this, and I would really wish you would stop calling
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> PayPal payment. Okay, just for an hour. I really don't want to PayPal payment. I really just,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you know, if you really want to talk to somebody who's really interested,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Google cryptozoologist here in the United States, and there's a whole bunch of will pull up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> I'll bring some notches over. We can watch this video. That'll be dynamite.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hi, yeah, I was looking for like a 30-day loan.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> The loan period is 30 days, but you don't have to pick up the loan. After that 30,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> you just have to pay the interest charge, and every time you pay the interest charge, it extends
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> that loan 30 days. Okay, great. I've got a Lebanese lamb. What would I get monetarily for something
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> like that? So like an animal? Yeah.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Hey, yeah, I think we've got to cut off up there. No, I hung up on you because I figured you were
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> messing with me. Messing with you. I'm just trying to get a dollar amount.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> Okay. What if you and your lamb can go fuck themselves? If you're that retarded to think
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> a pawn shop, we take a live animal and I have to explain that to you. I'm surprised you can
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> breathe on your own. Hey, how about I come up there and body blow body blow. Come on up, bud.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_08:</strong> I love you. I'm here till seven. Come by any time. Body blow body blow. How's that sound?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
