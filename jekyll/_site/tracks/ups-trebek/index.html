      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> A scam.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> A scam.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sir, this is a pouch, a parcel.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We're trying to deliver to you, do our job here, and you're not exactly cooperating.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Can you look at it from our side for a moment here?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You won't even tell me my address.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, I've got your address right here on my computer system.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Then you will need to tell me that for me to believe you that you're not full of shit.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I've got to log in.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That takes a minute to do while we're talking here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But what we do with...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It doesn't really sound like you work for a Fortune 500 company to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It sounds to me like you're a scammer trying to rip off old people.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you could read the routing number and we can process the payment,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> we can leave the item in a safe place, that's certainly no problem.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Not a problem also.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But do people fall for this often?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I mean, honestly, who is this stupid?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Sir, I'm with United Parcel Service.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm super entertained by your whole...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This isn't FedEx or D.HL.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This isn't some fly-by-night company.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> We're United Parcel Service guy, and I've been here for two years.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I know quite well what UPS is.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> However, I don't believe that you have anything to do with any company.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's anything.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I think you're some fucking idiot in another town trying to rip people off,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> which is pretty clear that that's what you are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm enjoying berating you over it because I've never done the COD of you in my goddamn life.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Not to mention it doesn't exist anymore.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Who is this stupid?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This is a colorful bunch of parcels here intended for you,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and we're just trying to do our job.
      <br>

    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> It's very important that I pay for a parcel.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You know what the fuck, man?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Who is this fucking stupid?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You know what, honestly, you're in Oregon, so it says?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I mean, whatever your Google Voice number,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> whatever it is you got, to do this call.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You know, I'm obviously going to call law enforcement after this.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, don't do that.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, why wouldn't I?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I just deal in package fulfillment here at UPS.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, well, then what do you have to worry about, my friend?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Nothing at all.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you have a credit card, Master Charge, I'm happy to take that from me and get it out the door.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> First of all, master charge hasn't existed in many years.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> So you're full of shit on so many possible fucking levels that I'm enjoying hearing you do your stupid spiel.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I just can't believe anybody is so dumb as to give you who sound like a complete fucking moron.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Honestly, I've dealt with scammers before, and you were possibly the most ridiculously
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> bad scam I've ever ever encountered.
      <br>

      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I see.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's because I'm trying to do a legitimate service for the community here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh, for the community.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I'm not one of your criminal-minded buddies here.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You're just a very bad criminal.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm a corporate employee and a corporate structure.
      <br>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> You didn't call me just now.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Did not.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Your phone rang and you picked up.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Nope.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> My phone rang about five minutes ago.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I picked up and another gentleman was on phone.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I told that gentleman I'd like to speak to his supervisor and I got you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I don't know how that happened.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> There's somebody who's been jerking around the phone system for quite some time,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> a couple of years, and manages to cross-connect three different people in different parts of the country.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> So it looks like you are a newcomer to this procedure.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't know. I'm familiar with what's going on. This is a scammer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I assume you're in Cahoochman.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But in any case, that's all it is. You're a scammer.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> That's what you are.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You're full of shit.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I've had enough.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I have to go back.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Your call has been forward to an automatic police message.

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Good, thank you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So we've got a parcel here. We've tried to deliver two other occasions
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and there wasn't anybody there.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Well, I won't be here until...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Ooh.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I'll be here for a window from about 1 o'clock to...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Well... 12.30 to...
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> No, shoot. Today's not good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Uh-huh. I hear that all the time.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Tomorrow and Friday are both good.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> How about in June?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I mean, we can just hold off and give you plenty of time, if you'd rather.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Well, I suggest I talk to your manager.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, why is that?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Because I'm not responsible for you coming when I'm not home.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> It's not like I'm dodging you.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And I gave you an answer that today I'm not going to be available.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I have a meeting here shortly, and I'll be home between 1230 and 2.30.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> That's a real small window.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> I thought it would be nicer to say,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> like, I'll be home all of tomorrow and all of Friday.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And then most of next week, and you're talking, June,
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> it's like, all of a sudden you turned bitter and rude to me.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And now I want to talk to your math.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> And now I want to talk to your math.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> manager.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, how about you cancel the meeting?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Who are you?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm Barborella with United Parcel Service.

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm an accountant.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> You're an accountant and you're making these trains of calls?
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, I mean, after three attempts that gets kicked back to my department, miss.
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_06:</strong> Well, I'm terribly sorry that I wasn't home for the delivery barborella.
      <br>
    </li>

      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, do you have a debit card we can use to process your payment for the COD?
      <br>
