    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> UPS.com
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Every detail of the way that you find your story sounds like the kind of thing designed to make old people fall for a scam
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Uh scam. So this is a pouch a parcel
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Uh, we're trying to deliver to you do our job here and you're not exactly cooperating

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You won't even tell me my address

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> But what do you do? It doesn't really sound like you work for a fortune 500 company to me
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> It sounds to me like you're a scam or trying to rip off old people
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> If you could read the routing number and we can process the payment we can leave the item in a safe place
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's certainly no problem. Not a problem
    <br>
  </li>

    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> But do people fall for this often?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I mean, honestly, who is this stupid?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> So
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> This isn't fly-by-night company. Were you not a parcel service guy and I've been here for two years
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I know quite well that UPS is however
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I don't believe that you have anything to do with any company that any
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I think you're some fucking idiot in another town trying to rip people off
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Which is pretty clear that that's what you are. I'm enjoying berating you over it
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Because I've never done a few of you in my god damn life. Nothing. It doesn't exist anymore
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> He's stupid. This is a colorful bunch of parcels here intended for you and we're just trying to do our job
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Package for filming. It's very important that I pay for a parcel
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> No, the fuck man. Who is this fucking stupid?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You know what? Honestly, you're in Oregon. So it says I mean whatever your google voice number whatever it is you got to do this call
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You know, I'm obviously gonna call law enforcement after this. Oh, don't do that
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Oh, why wouldn't I just deal in package fulfillment here at UPS?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Well, then what do you have to worry about my friend?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Nothing at all. If you have a credit card master charge, I'm happy to take that from me and get it out the door. That's all
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Master charge hasn't existed in many years. So you're full of shit on so many possible fucking levels, but I'm enjoying
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Hearing you do your stupid spiel. I just can't believe anybody is so dumb as to give you who sound like a complete fucking moron
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Honestly, I've dealt with scammers before and you were possibly the most ridiculously bad scam I've ever ever encountered
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Thank you because I'm trying to do a legitimate service for the
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> Oh for the community. I'm not one of your clearly-minded buddies here. I'm just a very bad criminal
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> employee in a corporate structure
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I've never ordered any security in my life and never would I deal with package fulfillment guy
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Get used to a package fulfillment all day long. Yes, I do sir. Yes, I do UPS
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Why don't you oh, oh, why don't I speak to your supervisor for the quote?

    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Alex, who do you work for?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> What does it matter who you called me?
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I didn't call you
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I couldn't call you at all. You guys can't get your stories to eat
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> My phone just rang and I picked up and I said hello
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> So, okay, well, I'm getting calls from this number. I'm like, why don't I explain to you? I'd like you to explain yourself
    <br>
  </li>

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Oh, well sure did. So why don't you explain to me who you are why I'm talking to you?

    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Did not
    <br>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Your phone rang and you picked up
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Nope, my phone rang about five minutes ago. I picked up and another gentleman was on phone
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I told that gentleman I'd like to speak to his supervisor and I got you
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I don't know how that happened. There's somebody who's been jerking around the phone system

    <br>
  </li>
